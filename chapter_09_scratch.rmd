Aswe wrap up, it is important to remember that these tools are limited by the
quality of the data collected. If you are ever involved in applying these
statistical models, whether in a research or industrial setting, make sure that
the research questions are discussed before data collection. And before data
collection is started, make sure that the methods will provide results that can
address the research questions. And, finally, make sure someone involved in the
project knows how to perform the appropriate statistical analysis. One way to
make sure you know how to analyze a data set and, often, clarify the research
questions and data collection needs, is to  **** . With this sort of preparation, many issuescan be avoided. Remember to think about reasons why assumptions of your
proposed method might be violated.

Youare now  ****  and a bit  ****  with statistical methods. Ifyou go to use them, remember the fundamentals and find the story in the data. 
After deciding on any research questions of interest, graph the data and make
sure that the statistical methods will give you results that make some sense
based on the graphical results. In the MLR results, it is possible that graphs
will not be able to completely tell you the story, but all the other methods
should follow the pictures you see. Even when (or especially when) you use
sophisticated statistical methods, graphical presentations are critical to
helping others understand the results. We have discussed examples that involve
displaying categorical and quantitative variables and even some displays that
bridge both types of variables. We hope you have enjoyed this material and been
able to continue to develop your interests in statistics. You will see it in
many future situations both in courses in your area of study and in real
problems that need answers. You are also prepared to take more advanced
statistics courses - if you want to discuss the next options, we are happy to
provide additional information about the best next steps in learning
statistics.
