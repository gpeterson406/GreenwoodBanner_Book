Dr. Robison-Cox initially developed this course using R and much of this work retains his initial ideas. Many years of teaching these topics and helping researchers use these topics has helped to refine how they are presented here. Observing students years after the course has also helped to refine what we try to teach in the course, trying to prepare these students for the next levels of statistics courses that they might encounter and the next class where they might need or want to use statistics. I (Greenwood) have intentionally taken a first person perspective at times to be able to include stories from some of those interactions to try to help you avoid some of their pitfalls in your current or future usage of statistics. I would like to thank my wife, Teresa Greenwood, for allowing me the time and support to work on this. I would also like to acknowledge Dr. Gordon Bril (Luther College) who introduced me to statistics while I was an undergraduate and Dr. Snehalata Huzurbazar (University of Wyoming) that guided me to completing my Master’s and Ph.D. in Statistics and still serves as a valued mentor and friend to me. The development of this text was initially supported with funding from Montana State University’s Instructional Innovation Grant Program with a grant titled Towards more active learning in STAT 217. This book was born with the goal of having a targeted presentation of topics that we cover (and few that we don’t) that minimizes cost to students and incorporates the statistical software R from day one and every day after that. The software is a free, open-source platform and so is dynamically changing over time. This has necessitated frequent revisions of the text. This is Version 3.01 of the book. It fixes a problem created with the digital links in the book that occurred during Spring 2017. Version 3.0 of the book, prepared for Fall 2016, involved edits, a couple of partially new sections, and updated R code along with a new format for how the R code is displayed to more easily distinguish it from other text. Each revision has involved a similar amount of change with Version 2.0 published in January 2015 and Version 1.0 in January 2014 after using draft chapters that were initially developed during Fall 2013. We have made every attempt to keep costs as low as possible by making it possible for most pages to be printed in black and white. The text (in full color and with dynamic links) is also available as a free digital download from Montana State University’s ScholarWorks repository at https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2999.

["chapter5.html", "Chapter 1 Chi-square tests 1.1 Situation, contingency tables, and plots", " Chapter 1 Chi-square tests 1.1 Situation, contingency tables, and plots In this chapter, the focus shifts briefly from analyzing quantitative response variables to methods for handling categorical response variables. This is important because in some situations it is not possible to measure the response variable quantitatively. For example, we will analyze the results from a clinical trial where the results for the subjects were measured as one of three categories: no improvement, some improvement, and marked improvement. While that type of response could be treated as numerical, coded possibly as 1, 2, and 3, it would be difficult to assume that the responses such as those follow a normal distribution since they are discrete (not continuous, measured at whole number values only) and, more importantly, the difference between no improvement and some improvement is not necessarily the same as the difference between some and marked improvement. If it is treated numerically, then the differences are assumed to be the same unless a different coding scheme is used (say 1, 2, and 5). It is better to treat these types of responses as being in one of the three categories and use statistical methods that don’t make unreasonable assumptions about what the numerical coding might mean. The study being performed here involved subjects randomly assigned to either a treatment or a placebo (control) group and we want to address research questions similar to those considered in Chapters ?? and ?? – assessing differences among two or more groups. With quantitative responses, the differences in the distributions are parameterized via the means of the groups and we used 2-sample mean or ANOVA hypotheses and tests. With categorical responses, the focus is on the probabilities of getting responses in each category and whether they differ among the groups. We start with some useful summary techniques, both numerical and graphical, applied to some examples of studies these methods can be used to analyze. Graphical techniques provide opportunities for assessing specific patterns in variables, relationships between variables, and for generally understanding the responses obtained. There are many different types of plots and each can enhance certain features of data. We will start with a “fun” display, called a tableplot, to help us understand some aspects of the results from a double-blind randomized clinical trial investigating a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that has the categorical response variable introduced previously. These data are available in the Arthritis data set available in the vcd package (Meyer, Zeileis, and Hornik 2016). There were \\(n=84\\) subjects, with some demographic information recorded along with the Treatment status (Treated, Placebo) and whether the patients’ arthritis symptoms Improved (with levels of None, Some, and Marked). The tableplot function from the tabplot package (Tennekes and de Jonge 2017) displays bars for each response in a row1 based on the category of responses or as a bar with the height corresponding the value of quantitative variables. It also plots a red cell if the observations were missing on a particular variable. The plot can be obtained simply as tableplot(DATASETNAME). But when using tableplot, we may not want to display everything in the data.frame and often just select some of the variables. We use Treatment, Improved, Sex, and Age in the select=... option with a c() and commas between the names of the variables we want to display. The first one in the list is also the one that the data are sorted based on. require(vcd) data(Arthritis) #Double-blind clinical trial with treatment and control groups #Homogeneity example require(tabplot) tableplot(Arthritis,select=c(Treatment,Improved,Sex,Age)) Figure 1.1: Table plot of the arthritis data set. The first thing we can gather from Figure 1.1 is that there are no red cells so there were no missing observations in the data set. Missing observations regularly arise in real studies when observations are not obtained for many different reasons and it is always good to check for missing data issues – this plot provides a quick visual method for doing that check. Primarily we are interested in whether the treatment led to a different pattern (or rates) of improvement responses. There seems to be more purple (Marked) improvement responses in the treatment group and more blue (None) responses in the placebo group. This sort of plot also helps us to simultaneously consider the role of other variables in the observed responses. You can see the sex of each subject in the vertical panel for Sex and it seems that there is a relatively reasonable mix of males and females in the treatment/placebo groups. Quantitative variables are also displayed with horizontal bars corresponding to the responses. From the panel for Age, we can see that the ages of subjects ranged from the 20s to 70s and that there is no clear difference in the ages between the treated and placebo groups. If, for example, all the male subjects had ended up being randomized into the treatment group, then we might have worried about whether sex and treatment were confounded and whether any differences in the responses might be due to sex instead of the treatment. The random assignment of treatment/placebo to the subjects appears to have been successful here with the ages and sexes appearing to be well-mixed among the two treatment groups. The main benefit of this sort of plot is the ability to visualize more than two categorical variables simultaneously. But now we want to focus more directly on the researchers’ main question – does the treatment lead to different improvement outcomes than the placebo? To directly assess the effects of the treatment, we want to display just the two variables of interest. Stacked bar charts provide a method of displaying the response patterns (in Improved) across the levels of a predictor variable(Treatment) by displaying a bar for each predictor variable level and the proportions of responses in each category of the response in each of those groups. If the placebo is as effective as the treatment, then we would expect similar proportions of responses in each improvement category. A difference in the effectiveness would manifest in different proportions in the different improvement categories between Treated and Placebo. To get information in this direction, we start with obtaining the counts in each combination of categories using the tally function to generate contingency tables. Contingency tables with R rows and C columns (called R by C tables) summarize the counts of observations in each combination of the explanatory and response variables. In these data, there are \\(R=2\\) rows and \\(C=3\\) columns making a \\(2\\times 3\\) table – note that you do not count the row and column for the “Totals” in defining the size of the table. In the table, there seems to be many more Marked improvement responses (21 vs 7) and fewer None responses (13 vs 29) in the treated group compared to the placebo group. require(mosaic) tally(~Treatment+Improved, data=Arthritis, margins=T) ## Improved ## Treatment None Some Marked Total ## Placebo 29 7 7 43 ## Treated 13 7 21 41 ## Total 42 14 28 84 Using the tally function with ~x+y provides a contingency table with the x variable on the rows and the y variable on the columns, with margins=T as an option so we can obtain the totals along the rows, columns, and table total of \\(N=84\\). In general, contingency tables contain the counts \\(n_{rc}\\) in the \\(r^{th}\\) row and \\(c^{th}\\) column where \\(r=1,\\ldots,R\\) and \\(c=1,\\ldots,C\\). We can also define the row totals as the sum across row \\(r\\) as \\[\\mathbf{n_{r\\bullet}}=\\Sigma^C_{c=1}n_{rc},\\] the column totals as the sum across column \\(c\\) as \\[\\mathbf{n_{\\bullet c}}=\\Sigma^R_{r=1}n_{rc},\\] and the table total as \\[\\mathbf{N}=\\Sigma^R_{r=1}\\mathbf{n_{r\\bullet}} = \\Sigma^C_{c=1}\\mathbf{n_{\\bullet c}} = \\Sigma^R_{r=1}\\Sigma^C_{c=1}\\mathbf{n_{rc}}.\\] We’ll need these quantities to do some calculations in a bit. A generic contingency table with added row, column, and table totals just like the previous result from the tally function is provided in Table 1.1. Table 1.1: General notation for counts in an R by C contingency table. Response Level 1 Response Level 2 Response Level 3 … Response Level C Totals \\(\\textbf{Group 1}\\) \\(n_{11}\\) \\(n_{12}\\) \\(n_{13}\\) \\(\\ldots\\) \\(n_{1C}\\) \\(\\mathbf{n_{1\\bullet}}\\) \\(\\textbf{Group 2}\\) \\(n_{21}\\) \\(n_{22}\\) \\(n_{23}\\) \\(\\ldots\\) \\(n_{2C}\\) \\(\\mathbf{n_{2\\bullet}}\\) \\(\\mathbf{\\ldots}\\) \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\mathbf{\\ldots}\\) \\(\\textbf{Group R}\\) \\(n_{R1}\\) \\(n_{R2}\\) \\(n_{R3}\\) \\(\\ldots\\) \\(n_{RC}\\) \\(\\mathbf{n_{R\\bullet}}\\) \\(\\textbf{Totals}\\) \\(\\mathbf{n_{\\bullet 1}}\\) \\(\\mathbf{n_{\\bullet 2}}\\) \\(\\mathbf{n_{\\bullet 3}}\\) \\(\\mathbf{\\ldots}\\) \\(\\mathbf{n_{\\bullet C}}\\) \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) Comparing counts from the contingency table is useful, but comparing proportions in each category is better, especially when the sample sizes in the levels of the explanatory variable differ. Switching the formula used in the tally function formula to ~ y | x and adding the format=&quot;proportion&quot; option provides the proportions in the response categories conditional on the category of the predictor (these are called conditional proportions or the conditional distribution of, here, Improved on Treatment)2. Note that they sum to 1.0 in each level of x, placebo or treated: See 1.2 Table 1.2: My table caption Response Level 1 Response Level 2 Response Level 3 … Response Level C Totals Group 1 \\(n_{11}\\) \\(n_{12}\\) \\(n_{13}\\) … \\(n_{15}\\) \\(n_{11}\\) Group 2 \\(n_{21}\\) \\(n_{22}\\) \\(n_{23}\\) … \\(n_{25}\\) \\(n_{21}\\) … … … … … … … Group R \\(n_{R1}\\) \\(n_{R2}\\) \\(n_{R3}\\) … \\(n_{R5}\\) \\(n_{R1}\\) Totals \\(\\boldsymbol{n_{\\bullet 1}}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{n_{\\bullet 2}}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{n_{\\bullet 3}}\\) $… \\(\\boldsymbol{n_{\\bullet C}}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{n_{\\bullet 1}}\\) "]
