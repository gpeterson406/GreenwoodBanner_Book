## Situation {#section4-1}

\indent In this chapter, we extend the One-Way ANOVA to situations with two factors or categorical explanatory
variables in a method that is generally called the ***Two-Way ANOVA***. This 
allows researchers to simultaneously study two variables that might
explain variability in the responses and explore whether the impacts of one
variable change depending on the level of the other explanatory variable. In some situations, each
observation is so expensive that researchers want to use a single study to
explore two different sets of research questions in the same round of data
collection. For example, a company might want to study factors that affect the
number of defective products per day and are interested in the impacts of two
different types of training programs and three different levels of production
quotas. These methods would allow engineers to compare the training programs, 
production quotas, and see if the training programs work differently for
different production quotas. In a clinical trials context, it is well known
that certain factors can change the performance of certain drugs. For example, 
different dosages of a drug might have different benefits or side-effects on
men, versus women or children. **When the impact of one factor on the response changes depending on the
level of another factor**, we say that the two explanatory variables ***interact***. It is also possible 
for both factors to be related to differences in the mean responses and not 
interact. For example, suppose there is a difference in the
response means between men and women and a difference among various dosages, 
but the effect of increasing the dosage is the same for the male and female
subjects. This is an example of what is called an ***additive*** type of model. 
In general, the world is more complicated than the single factor models we
considered in Chapter \@ref(chapter3) can account for, especially in 
observational studies, so these models allow us to start to handle more 
realistic situations. 

\indent Consider the following "experiment" where we want to compare the strength of 
different brands of paper towels when they are wet. The response variable 
will be the time to failure in seconds (a continuous response variable) when 
a weight is placed on the towel held at the four corners. We are interested 
in studying the differences between brands and the impact of different amounts 
of water applied to the towels. 

* Predictors (Explanatory Variables): **A**: ``Brand`` (2 brands of interest, 
named *B1* and *B2*) and **B**: Number of ``Drops`` of water (10, 20, 30 drops).

* Response: *Time* to failure (in seconds) of a towel ($y$) with a weight 
sitting in the middle of the towel. 

## Designing a two-way experiment and visualizing results	{#section4-2}

\indent Ideally, we want to randomly assign the levels of each factor so that we can 
attribute causality to any detected effects and to reduce the chances of 
*confounding*. Because there are two factors, we would need to design a random 
assignment scheme to select the levels of both variables. For example, we could 
randomly select a brand and then randomly select the number of drops to apply 
from the levels chosen for each measurement. Or we could decide on how many 
observations we want at each combination of the two factors (ideally having 
them all equal so the design is ***balanced***) and then randomize the order 
of applying the different combinations of levels. 

\indent Why might it be important to randomly apply the brand and number of drops in 
an experiment? There are situations where the order of observations can be 
related to changes in the responses and we want to be able to eliminate 
the order of observations from being related to the levels of the factors -- otherwise the order of observations and levels of the factors would be *confounded*. 
For example, suppose that the area where the experiment is being performed 
becomes wet over time and the later measurements have extra water that gets 
onto the paper towels and they tend to fail more quickly. If all the observations 
for the second brand were done later in the study, then the *order of observations*
impacts could make the second brand look worse. If the order of measurements to be made is 
randomized, then even if there is some drift in the responses over the order 
of observations it should still be possible to see the differences in the 
randomly assigned effects. If the study incorporates repeated measurements on 
human subjects, randomizing the order of treatments they are exposed to can 
alleviate impacts of them "learning" through the study, something that we 
would not have to worry about with paper towels. 

\indent In observational studies, we do not have the luxury of random assignment, that 
is, we cannot randomly assign levels of the treatment variables to our 
subjects, so we cannot guarantee that the only difference between the groups 
are based on the differences in the explanatory variables. As discussed before, because we can't control 
which level of the variables are assigned to the subjects, we cannot make 
causal inferences and have to worry about other variables being the real 
drivers of the results. Although we can never establish causal inference 
with observational studies, we can generalize our results to a larger 
population if we have a representative (ideally fully random) sample from our population of interest. 

\indent It is also possible that we might have studies where some of the variables are 
randomly assigned and others that are not randomly assignable. The most common 
versions of this are what we sometimes call subject "demographics", such as 
sex, income, race, etc. We might be performing a study where we can randomly 
assign treatments to these subjects but might also want to account for 
differences based on income level, which we can't assign. In these cases, the 
scope of inference gets complicated -- differences seen on randomized variables 
can be causally interpreted but you have to be careful to not say that the 
demographics caused differences. Suppose that a randomly assigned drug dosage 
is found to show differences in male patients but not in female patients. We 
could say that the dosage causes differences in males but does not in females. 
We are not saying that sex caused the differences but that the causal 
differences were modified by the sex of the subjects. 

\indent Even when we do have random assignment of treatments it is important to think 
about who/what is included in the sample. To get back to the paper towel 
example, we are probably interested in more than the sheets of the rolls 
we have to work with. If we could randomly select the studied paper towels 
from all paper towels made by each brand, our conclusions could be extended 
to those populations. That probably would not be practical, but trying to 
make sure that the towels are representative of all made by each brand by 
checking for defects and maybe picking towels from a few different rolls 
would be a good start to being able to extend inferences beyond the tested 
towels. If you were doing this in the factory, it might be possible to randomly sample from the towels produced.

\indent Once random assignment and random sampling is settled, the final aspect of 
study design involves deciding on the number of observations that should be 
made. The short (glib) answer is to take as many as you can afford. With more 
observations comes higher power to detect differences if they exist, which 
is a desired attribute of all studies. It is also important to make sure that 
you obtain multiple observations at each combination of the treatment levels, 
which are called ***replicates***. Having replicate measurements allows 
estimation of the mean for each combination of the treatment levels as well 
as estimation and testing for an interaction. And we always prefer having 
balanced designs because they provide resistance to violation of some 
assumptions as noted in Chapter \@ref(chapter3). A ***balanced design***
in a Two-Way ANOVA setting involves having the same sample size for every
combination of the levels of the treatments. 

\indent With two categorical explanatory variables, there are now five possible 
scenarios for the truth. Different situations are created depending on 
whether there is an interaction between the two variables, 
whether both variables are important but do not interact, or whether either of the
variables matter at all. Basically, there are five different possible outcomes
in a randomized Two-Way ANOVA study, listed in order of increasing model
complexity:

1. Neither A or B has an effect on the responses (nothing causes differences 
in responses). 

2. A has an effect, B does not (only A causes differences in responses). 

3. B has an effect, A does not (only B causes differences in responses). 

4. Both A and B have effects on response but no interaction (A and B both 
cause differences in responses but the impacts are *additive*). 

5. Effect of A on response differs based on the levels of B, the opposite is also true 
(means for levels of response across A are different for different levels of B, or, simply, 
A and B interact in their effect on the response). 

To illustrate these five potential outcomes, we will consider a fake version of
the paper towel example. It ended up being really messy and complicated to
actually perform the experiment as we described it so these data were simulated. The hope is to use this simple example to illustrate some of the Two-Way ANOVA possibilities. The first step is to understand what has been observed (number
observations at each combination of factors) and look at some summary
statistics across all the "groups". The data set is available via the following link:

```{r}
require(readr)
pt <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/pt.csv")
pt$drops <- factor(pt$drops)
```

The data set contains five observations per combination of treatment levels as
provided by the ``tally`` function. To get counts for combinations of the 
variables, use the general formula of ``tally(x1~x2, data=...)`` -- noting that the  order of ``x1`` and ``x2`` doesn't matter here:

```{r}
require(mosaic)
tally(brand~drops, data=pt)
```

The sample sizes in each of the six treatment level combinations of ``Brand`` 
and ``Drops`` [(*B1*, 10), (*B1*, 20), (*B1*, 30), (*B2*, 10), (*B2*, 20), 
(*B2*, 30)] are $n_{jk} = 5$ for $j^{th}$ level of ``Brand`` ($j=1, 2$) and 
$k^{th}$ level of ``Drops`` ($k=1, 2, 3$). The ``tally`` function gives us a 
***contingency table*** with $R = 2$ rows (*B1*, *B2*) and $C = 3$ columns 
(10, 20, and 30). We'll have more fun with $R$ by $C$
tables in Chapter \@ref(chapter5) -- here it helps us to see the sample size in 
each combination of factor levels. The ``favstats`` function also helps us 
dig into the results for all combinations of factor levels. The notation 
involves putting both variables after the "~" with a "``+``" between them. 
In the output, the first row contains summary information for the
5 observations for ``Brand`` *B1* and ``Drops`` amount 10. It also contains the 
sample size in the ``n`` column, although here it rolled into a new set of 
rows with the standard deviations of each combination. 

```{r}
favstats(responses~brand+drops, data=pt)
```

\indent The next step is to visually explore the results across the combinations of  the two explanatory variables. The beanplot can be extended to handle these 
sorts of two-way situations only if one of the two variables is a two-level 
variable. This is a pretty serious constraint on this display, so we will 
show you the plot (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-1)) but not focus on the code. 
The reason beanplots can only handle $2 \times K$ designs is that the
beans are split along a vertical line for each of the $K$ levels of the other variable. 
In Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-1), the ``Brand`` B1 density curves are shaded and the 
B2 curves are not. In reading these plots, look for differences in each level 
and whether those differences change across the levels of the other variable. 
Specifically, start with comparing the two brands for different amounts of water. 
Do the brands seem different? Certainly for 10 drops of water the two look 
different but not for 30 drops. We can also look for combinations of factors 
that produce the highest or lowest responses in this display. It appears that 
the time to failure is highest in the low water drop groups but as the water 
levels increase, the time to failure falls and the differences in the two 
brands seem to decrease. The fake data seem to have relatively similar 
amounts of variability and distribution shapes -- remembering that there are 
only 5 observations available for describing the shape of responses for each 
combination. These data were simulated using a normal distribution and 
constant variance if that gives you some extra confidence in assessing these 
model assumptions. 

(ref:fig4-1) Beanplot of paper towel data by ``Drops`` (x-axis) and ``Brand`` 
(side of bean, shaded area for ``Brand`` *B1*). 

```{r Figure4-1,fig.cap="(ref:fig4-1)"}
require(beanplot)
beanplot(responses~brand*drops, data=pt, side="b", 
         col=list("lightblue","white"), xlab="Drops", ylab="Time", 
         method="jitter", log="")
legend("topright", bty="n", c("B1","B2"), fill=c("lightblue","white"))
```

\indent The beanplots can't handle situations where both variables have more than two 
levels -- we need a simpler display that just focuses on the means at the 
combinations of the two explanatory variables. The means for each combination 
of levels that you can find in the ``favstats`` output are more usefully used 
in what is called an ***interaction plot***. Interaction plots display the mean 
responses (y-axis) versus levels of one predictor variable on the x-axis, 
adding points and separate lines for each level of the other predictor variable. Because 
we don't like any of the available functions in R, we wrote our own function, 
called ``intplot`` that you can download using:

```{r}
source("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/intplot.R")
```

The function allows a formula interface like ``Y~X1*X2`` and provides the 
means $\pm$ 1 SE (vertical bars) and adds a legend to help make
everything clear. 

(ref:fig4-2) Interaction plot of the paper towel data with ``Drops`` on the x-axis and different lines based on ``Brand``. 

```{r Figure4-2,fig.cap="(ref:fig4-2)",fig.height=5,fig.width=8}
intplot(responses~brand*drops, data=pt)
```

Interaction plots can always be made two different ways by switching the order 
of the variables. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-2) contains ``Drops`` on the x-axis 
and Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-3) has ``Brand`` on the x-axis. Typically putting 
the variable with more levels on the x-axis will make interpretation easier, 
but not always. Try both and decide on the one that you like best. 

(ref:fig4-3) Interaction plot of paper towel data with ``Brand`` on the x-axis and lines based on ``Drops``. 

```{r Figure4-3, fig.cap="(ref:fig4-3)",fig.height=5,fig.width=8}
intplot(responses~drops*brand, data=pt)
```

The formula in this function builds on our previous notation and now we include
both predictor variables with an "``*``" between them. Using an asterisk between 
explanatory variables is one way of telling R to include an interaction between 
the variables. While the interaction may or may not be present, the interaction 
plot helps us to explore those potential differences. 

\indent There are a variety of aspects of the interaction plots to pay attention to. 
Initially, the question to answer is whether it appears that there is an 
interaction between the predictor variables. When there is an interaction, you 
will see ***non-parallel lines*** in the interaction plot. You want to look from 
left to right in the plot and assess whether the lines are close to parallel, 
relative to the amount of variability in the means. If it seems that there is 
clear visual evidence of non-parallel lines, then the interaction is likely 
worth considering (we will typically use a hypothesis test to formally assess 
this -- see discussion below). If the lines look to be close to parallel, then 
there probably isn't an interaction between
the variables. Without an interaction present, that means that the differences
in the response across levels of one variable doesn't change based on the levels of the other
variable and vice-versa. This means that we can consider the ***main effects***
of each variable on their own^[We will use "main effects" to refer to the two 
explanatory variables in the additive model even if they are not randomly 
assigned to contrast with having those variables interacting in the model. 
It is the one place in the book where we use "effects" without worrying about random 
assignment.]. Main effects are much like the results we found in 
Chapter \@ref(chapter3) where we can compare
means across levels of a single variable except that there are results for two
variables to extract from the model. With the presence of an interaction, it is
complicated to summarize how each variable is affecting the response variable
because their impacts change depending on the level of the other factor. And
plots like the interaction plot provide us with useful information. 

If the lines are not parallel, then
focus in on comparing the levels of one variable as the other variable changes. 
Remember that the definition of an interaction is that the differences among
levels of one variable depends on the level of the other variable being
considered. "Visually" this means comparing the size of the differences in the
lines from left to right. In Figures \@ref(fig:Figure4-2) and \@ref(fig:Figure4-3),
the effect of amount of water
changes based on the brand being considered. In Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-3), 
the three lines
represent the three water levels. The difference between the brands (left to
right, *B1* to *B2*) is different depending on how much water was present. It
appears that ``Brand`` *B2* lasted longer at the lower water levels but that the 
difference between the two brands dropped as the water levels increased. The 
same story appears in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-2). As the
water levels increase (left to right, 10 to 20 to 30 drops), the differences
between the two brands decrease. Of the two versions, Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-2)
is probably easier to read here. The interaction plots also are useful for 
identifying the best and worst mean responses for combinations of the treatment 
levels. For example, 10 ``Drops`` and ``Brand`` *B2* lasts longest, on average, and  30 ``Drops`` with ``Brand`` *B1* fails fastest, on average. In this situation, the  lines do not appear to be parallel suggesting that further exploration of the 
interaction appears to be warranted. 

\indent Before we get to the hypothesis tests
to formally make this assessment (you knew some sort of p-value was coming, right?), 
we can visualize the 5 different scenarios that could characterize the sorts of
results you could observe in a Two-Way ANOVA situation. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-4)
shows 4 of the 5 scenarios. In panel (a), when there are no differences from either
variable (Scenario 1), it provides relatively parallel lines and basically no
differences either across ``Drops`` levels (x-axis) or ``Brand`` (lines). This would 
result in no evidence related to a difference in brands, water
levels, or any interaction between them. 

(ref:fig4-4) Interaction plots of four possible scenarios in the paper towel study.

```{r Figure4-4, fig.cap="(ref:fig4-4)",echo=F,fig.width=6.5,fig.height=4}

        x.leg=3.2,cex.lab=0.75)
#Scenario 4: A and B additive
m4<-lm(responses~brand+drops,data=pt)
pt$r4<-fitted(m4)+res1
intplot(r4~brand*drops,ylim=c(0,3.2),data=pt,main="(d) Scenario 4: A and B additive",col=c(1,2),lwd=2,cex.main=1,cex.leg=0.75,xlim=c(0.8,3.8),
        x.leg=3.2,cex.lab=0.75)
```

\indent Scenario 2 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-4) panel (b))
incorporates differences based on factor A (here that is ``Brand``) but no real 
difference based on the ``Drops`` or any interaction. This results in a clear shift  between the lines for the means of the ``Brands`` but little to no changes in the level of those lines across water levels. 
These lines are relatively parallel. We can see that ``Brand`` *B2* is better than 
``Brand`` *B1* but that is all we can show with these sorts of results. 

\indent Scenario 3 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-4) panel (c)) flips the important variable
to B (``Drops``)
and shows decreasing average times as the water levels increase. Again, the 
interaction panels show near parallel-ness in the lines and really just show differences
among the levels of the water. In both Scenarios 2 and 3, we could use a single
variable and drop the other from the model, getting back to a One-Way ANOVA
model, without losing any important information. 

\indent Scenario 4 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-4) panel (d)) incorporates
effects of A and B, but they are ***additive***. That means that the effect
of one variable is the same across the levels of the other variable. In this 
experiment, that would mean that ``Drops`` has the same impact on performance 
regardless of brand and that the brands differ but each type of difference is 
the same regardless of levels of the other variable. 
The interaction plot lines are more or less parallel but now the brands are
clearly different from each other. The plot shows the decrease in performance
based on increasing water levels and that ``Brand`` *B2* is better than 
``Brand`` *B1*. Additive effects show the same difference in lines from left to 
right in the interaction plots. 

\indent Finally, Scenario 5 (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-5)) involves
an interaction between the two variables (``Drops`` and ``Brand``). There are many ways
that interactions can present but the main thing is to look for clearly
non-parallel lines. As noted in the previous discussion, the ``Drops`` effect 
appears to change depending on which level of ``Brand`` is being considered. 
Note that the plot here described as Scenario 5 is the same as the initial plot 
of the results in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-2). 

(ref:fig4-5) Interaction plot of Scenario 5 where it appears that an 
interaction is present. 

```{r Figure4-5, fig.cap="(ref:fig4-5)",echo=F,fig.height=3,fig.width=4.5}
old.par <- par(mai=c(1,1,0.75,1))
m5<-lm(responses~brand*drops,data=pt)
pt$r5<-fitted(m5)+res1
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
intplot(r5~brand*drops,ylim=c(0,3.2),data=pt,main="Scenario 5: Interaction between A and B",col=c(1,2),lwd=2,cex.leg=0.75,x.leg=3.2,xlim=c(0.8,3.8),
        cex.lab=0.75,cex.main=1)
```

\indent The typical modeling protocol is to start with assuming that Scenario 5 is a possible
description of the results, related to fitting what is called the 
***interaction model***, and then attempt to simplify the model (to the 
***additive model***) if warranted. We need a hypothesis test to help decide if 
the interaction is "real" -- if there
is sufficient evidence to prove that there is an interaction. We need a test
because the lines will never be exactly parallel and, just like in the One-Way
ANOVA situation, the amount of variation around the lines impacts the ability
of the model to detect differences, in this case of an interaction. 

## Two-Way ANOVA models and hypothesis tests	{#section4-3}

\indent To assess interactions with two
variables, we need to fully describe models for the additive and interaction
scenarios and then develop a method for assessing evidence of the need for
different aspects of the models. First, we need to define the notation for
these models:

* $y_{ijk}$ is the $i^{th}$ response from the group for level $j$ of factor A
and level $k$ of factor B

    * $j=1,\ldots,J$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $J$ is the number of levels of A
    
    * $k=1,\ldots,K$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $K$ is the number of levels of B
    
    * $i=1,\ldots,n_{jk}$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $n_{jk}$ is the sample size for level
    $j$ of factor A and level $k$ of factor B
    
    * $N=\Sigma\Sigma n_{jk}$ is the total sample size (sum of the number of 
    observations across all $JK$ groups)

We need to extend our previous discussion of reference-coded models to develop a
Two-Way ANOVA model. We start with the ***Two-Way ANOVA interaction model***:

$$y_{ijk} = \alpha + \tau_j + \gamma_k + \omega_{jk} + \varepsilon_{ijk},$$

\noindent where $\alpha$ is the baseline group mean (for level 1 of A **and** level 1 of B),
$\tau_j$ is the deviation for the ***main effect*** of A from the baseline
for levels $2,\ldots,J$, $\gamma_k$ (gamma $k$) is the deviation for the main 
effect of B from the baseline for levels $2,\ldots,K$, and $\omega_{jk}$ 
(omega $jk$) is the adjustment for the ***interaction effect*** for level 
$j$ of factor A and level $k$ of factor B for $j=1,\ldots,J$ and $k=1,\ldots,K$.
In this model, $\tau_1$, $\gamma_1$, and $\omega_{11}$ are all fixed at 0. 
As in Chapter \@ref(chapter3), R will choose the baseline categories
alphabetically but now it is choosing a baseline for both variables and so our
detective work will be doubled to sort this out. 

\indent If the interaction term is not important, based on the interaction test 
presented below, the $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}$ can be dropped from the model 
and we get a model that corresponds to Scenario 4
above. Scenario 4 is where there are two main effects but no interaction
between them. The ***additive Two-Way model*** is

$$y_{ijk} = \alpha + \tau_j + \gamma_k + \varepsilon_{ijk},$$

\noindent where each component is defined as in the interaction model. The difference between
the interaction and additive models is setting all the $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}$
to 0 that are present in the interaction model. When we set parameters to 0 in
models it removes them from the model. Setting parameters to 0 is how we will develop
our hypotheses to test for an interaction, by testing whether there is evidence
enough to reject that all $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}=0$.

\indent The interaction test hypotheses are 

* $H_0$: No interaction between A and B in population $\Leftrightarrow$ All
$\omega_{jk}\text{'s}=0$.

* $H_A$: Interaction between A and B in population $\Leftrightarrow$ At least
one $\omega_{jk}\ne 0$.

To perform this test, a new ANOVA $F$-test is required (presented below) but 
there are also hypotheses relating to the main effects of A ($\tau_j\text{'s}$)
and B ($\gamma_k\text{'s}$). If evidence is found to reject the null hypothesis 
that no interaction is
present, then it is dangerous to ignore it and test for the main effects
because important main effects can be masked by interactions (examples later). 
It is important to note that, by definition, **both variables matter if an
interaction is found to be important** so the main effect tests may not be 
very interesting. If the interaction is found
to be important based on the test and retained in the model, you should focus
on the interaction model (also called the ***full model***) in order to 
understand and describe the form of the interaction among the variables. 

\indent If the interaction test does not return
a small p-value and you decide that you do not have evidence to suggest that it is needed, it
can be dropped from the model. In this situation, we would re-fit the model and
focus on the results provided by the additive model -- performing tests for the
two additive main effects. For the first, but not last time, we encounter a
model with more than one variable and more than one test of potential interest. In models
with multiple variables at similar levels (here both are main effects), we are
interested in the results for each variable given that the other variable is in
the model. In many situations, including more than one variable in a model
changes the results for the other variable even if those variables do not
interact. The reason for this is more clear in Chapter \@ref(chapter8) and really only
matters here if we have unbalanced designs, but we need to start adding a short
modifier to our discussions of main effects -- they are the results 
*conditional on* or *adjusting for* or, simply, *given*, the other variable(s) 
in the model. Specifically, the hypotheses for the two main effects are: 

* Main effect test for A:

    * $H_0$: No differences in means across levels of A in population, 
    given B in the model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ All $\tau_j\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model. 
    
    * $H_A$: Some difference in means across levels A in population, 
    given B in the model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ At least one $\tau_j \ne 0$, in additive model. 

* Main effect test for B:

    * $H_0$: No differences in means across levels of B in population, 
    given A in the model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ All $\gamma_k\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model. 
    
    * $H_A$: Some difference in means across levels B in population, 
    given A in the model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ At least one $\gamma_k \ne 0$, in additive model. 
    
\indent In order to test these effects (interaction in the interaction model and 
main effects in the additive model), $F$-tests are developed using Sums of
Squares, Mean Squares, and degrees of freedom similar to those in 
Chapter \@ref(chapter3). We
won't worry about the details of the sums of squares formulas but you should
remember the sums of squares decomposition, which still applies^[In the standard 
ANOVA table, 
$\text{SS}_A + \text{SS}_B + \text{SS}_{AB} + \text{SS}_E = \text{SS}_{\text{Total}}$. 
However, to get the tests we really desire when our designs are not balanced, a
slight modification of the SS is used, using what are called Type II sums of
squares and this result doesn't hold in the output you will see for additive
models. This is discussed further below.]. Table \@ref(tab:Table4-1) 
summarizes the ANOVA results you will obtain for the interaction
model and Table \@ref(tab:Table4-2) provides the similar general results for the additive
model. As we saw in Chapter \@ref(chapter3), the degrees of freedom are the amount of
information that is free to vary at a particular level and that rule generally holds
here. For example, for factor A with $J$ levels, there are $J-1$ parameters that
are free since the baseline is fixed. The residual degrees of freedom for both
models are not as easily explained but have a simple formula. Note that the sum
of the degrees of freedom from the main effects, (interaction if present), and
error need to equal $N-1$, just like in the One-Way ANOVA table.

The mean squares are formed by taking the sums of squares (we'll let R find those
for us) and dividing by the $df$ in the row. The $F$-ratios are found by taking
the mean squares from the row and dividing by the mean squared error ($\text{MS}_E$). 
They follow $F$-distributions with numerator degrees
of freedom from the row and denominator degrees of freedom from the Error row
(in R output this the ``Residuals`` row). It is possible to develop permutation 
tests for these methods but some
technical issues arise in doing permutation tests for interaction model components
so we will not use them here. This means we will have to place even more
emphasis on meeting the assumptions since we only have the parametric method
available.

\indent With some basic expectations about the ANOVA tables and $F$-statistic construction 
in mind, we can get to actually estimating the models and exploring the results. 
The first example involves the fake paper towel data
displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-1) and \@ref(fig:Figure4-2). It appeared 
that Scenario 5 was the correct
story since the lines were not parallel, but we need to know whether there is
evidence to suggest that the interaction is "real" and we get that through the 
interaction hypothesis test. To fit the interaction model using ``lm``, 
the general formulation is ``lm(y~x1*x2, data=...)``. The
order of the variables doesn't matter and the most important part of the model,
to start with, relates to the interaction of the variables. 

\indent The ANOVA table output
shows the results for the interaction model obtained by running the ``anova``
function on the model called ``m1``. Specifically, the test that 
$H_0: \text{ All } \omega_{jk}\text{'s} = 0$ has a
test statistic of $F(2,24)=1.92$ (in the output from the row with 
brands:drops) and a p-value of 0.17. So there is weak evidence against the null hypothesis of no interaction, with a 17% chance we would 
observe a difference in the $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}$ like we did or more
extreme if the $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}$ really were all 0. So it seems that the interaction probably is not needed. Note that for the interaction 
model components, R presents them with a colon, ``:``, between the variable 
names.

```{r}
m1<-lm(responses ~ brand*drops, data=pt)
anova(m1)
```

It is useful to display the estimates from this model and we can utilize
``plot(allEffects(MODELNAME))`` to visualize the results for the terms 
in our models. If we turn on the options for ``grid=T``, ``multiline=T``, 
and ``ci.style="bars"`` we will get a more useful version of the basic 
"effect plot" for Two-Way ANOVA
models with interaction. The results of the estimated interaction model are
displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-6), which looks very similar to our 
previous interaction plot. The only difference is that this comes from model 
that assumes equal variance and these plots show 95% confidence intervals 
for the means instead of the 1 standard error used above that was calculated using the variance of the observations at each combination of levels. 

(ref:fig4-6) Plot of estimated results of interaction model for the paper towel performance data. 

```{r Figure4-6,fig.cap="(ref:fig4-6)",echo=F,fig.width=6,fig.asp=.75}
require(effects)
plot(allEffects(m1), grid=T, multiline=T, ci.style="bars")
```

\indent In the absence of evidence to include the
interaction, the model should be simplified to the additive model and the interpretation
focused on each main effect, conditional on having the other variable in the
model. To fit an additive model and not include an interaction, the model
formula involves a "+" instead of a "``*``" between the explanatory variables. 

```{r}
m2<-lm(responses~brand+drops, data=pt)
anova(m2)
```

The p-values for the main effects of ``brand`` and ``drops`` change slightly from the
results in the interaction model due to changes in the $\text{MS}_E$ from
0.4118 to 0.4409 (more variability is left over in the simpler model) and the
$\text{DF}_{\text{error}}$ that increases from 24 to 26. In both models, the 
$\text{SS}_{\text{Total}}$ is the same (20.6544). In the interaction model, 

$$\begin{array}{rl}
\text{SS}_{\text{Total}} & = \text{SS}_{\text{brand}} + \text{SS}_{\text{drops}}
+ \text{SS}_{\text{brand:drops}} + \text{SS}_{\text{E}}\\
& = 4.3322 + 4.8581 + 1.5801 + 9.8840.\\
& = 20.6544\\
\end{array}$$

In the additive model, the variability that was attributed to the interaction term
in the interaction model ($\text{SS}_{\text{brand:drops}} = 1.5801$) is pushed into the
$\text{SS}_{\text{E}}$, which increases from 9.884 to 11.4641. The sums of squares
decomposition in the additive model is 

$$\begin{array}{rl}
\text{SS}_{\text{Total}} & = \text{SS}_{\text{brand}} + \text{SS}_{\text{drops}}
 + \text{SS}_{\text{E}} \\
& = 4.3322 + 4.8581 + 11.4641 \\
& = 20.6544. \\
\end{array}$$

This shows that the sums of squares decomposition applies in these more complicated
models as it did in the One-Way ANOVA. It also shows that if the interaction is
removed from the model, that variability is lumped in with the other
unexplained variability that goes in the $\text{SS}_{\text{E}}$ in any model.

\indent The fact that the sums of squares decomposition can be applied here is 
useful, except that there is a small issue
with the main effect tests in the ANOVA table results that follow this
decomposition when the design is not balanced. It ends up that the tests in a
typical ANOVA table are only conditional on the tests higher up in the table. For
example, in the additive model ANOVA table, the ``Brand`` test is not 
conditional on the ``Drops`` effect, but the ``Drops`` effect is conditional on the 
``Brand`` effect. To fix this issue, we have to use another type of sums of 
squares, called ***Type II sums of squares***. They will no longer always 
follow the rules of the sums of squares decomposition but they
will test the desired hypotheses. Specifically, they provide each test
conditional on any other terms at the same level of the model and match the
hypotheses written out earlier in this section. To get the "correct" ANOVA
results, the ``car`` (@R-car, @Fox2011) package is required. We use the 
``Anova`` function on our linear models from here forward to get the "right" 
tests in our ANOVA tables^[The ``anova`` results are not wrong, just not what we want.]. Note how the case-sensitive nature of R code shows 
up in the use of the capital-A ``Anova`` function instead of the ``anova`` 
function used previously. In this case, because the design was balanced, the
results are the same using either function. Observational studies rarely
generate balanced designs (some designed studies can result in unbalanced
designs) so we will generally just use the Type II version of the sums of
squares. The ``Anova`` results using the Type II sums of
squares are slightly more conservative than the results from ``anova``, 
which are called Type I sums of squares. The sums of squares decomposition no
longer can be applied, but it is a small sacrifice to get each test after
adjusting for all other variables^[Actually, the tests are only conditional 
on other main effects if Type II Sums of Squares are used for an interaction 
model.].

```{r, warning=F,message=F}
require(car)
Anova(m2)
```

The new output switches the columns around and doesn't show you the mean squares, 
but gives the most critical parts of the output. Here, there is no change in
results because it is balanced design with equal counts of responses in each
combination of the two explanatory variables. 

\indent The additive model, when appropriate, provides simpler interpretations for 
each explanatory variable compared to models
with interactions because the effect of one variable is the same regardless of
the levels of the other variable and vice versa. There are two tools to aid in
understanding the impacts of the two variables in the additive model. First, 
the model summary provides estimated coefficients with interpretations like
those seen in Chapter \@ref(chapter3) (deviation of group $j$ or $k$ from 
the baseline group's mean), except with the additional wording of 
"controlling for" the other variable
added to any of the discussion. Second, the term-plots now show each main
effect and how the groups differ with one panel for each of the two explanatory
variables in the model. These term-plots are created by holding the other
variable constant at one of its levels. 

```{r}
summary(m2)
```

\indent In the model summary, the baseline combination estimated in the ``(Intercept)``
row is for ``Brand`` *B1* and ``Drops`` 10 and estimates the mean failure 
time as 1.85 seconds for this combination. As
before, the group labels that do not show up are the baseline but there are two
variables' baselines to identify. Now the "simple" aspects of the additive
model show up. The interpretation of the ``Brands`` *B2* coefficient is as 
a deviation from the baseline but it applies regardless of the level of 
``Drops``. Any difference between *B1* and *B2* involves a shift up of 0.76 seconds
in the estimated mean failure time. Similarly, going from 10 (baseline) to 20
drops results in a drop in the estimated failure mean of 0.47 seconds and going
from 10 to 30 drops results in a drop of almost 1 second in the average time to
failure, both estimated changes are the same regardless of the brand of paper
towel being considered. Sometimes, especially in observational studies, we use
the terminology "controlled for" to remind the reader that the other variable
was present in the model^[In Multiple Linear Regression models in 
Chapter \@ref(chapter8), the reasons for this wording will (hopefully) 
become clearer.] and also explained some of the variability in the 
responses. The term-plots for
the additive model (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-7)) help us visualize the 
impacts of changes brand and changing water levels, holding the other 
variable constant. The differences in heights in each panel correspond 
to the coefficients just discussed. 

(ref:fig4-7) Term-plots of additive model for paper towel data. Left panel displays
results for two brands and right panel for number of drops of water, each after
controlling for the other.

## Guinea pig tooth growth analysis with Two-Way ANOVA	{#section4-4}

\indent The effects of dosage and delivery method of ascorbic acid on Guinea Pig 
odontoblast growth was analyzed as a One-Way ANOVA in Section \@ref(section3-5)
by assessing evidence of any difference in the
means of any combinations of dosage method (Vit C capsule vs Orange Juice) and
three dosage amounts (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day). Now we will consider the dosage
and delivery methods as two separate variables and explore their potential
interaction. A beanplot and interaction plot are provided in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-8).

(ref:fig4-8) Beanplot and interaction plot of the odontoblast growth data set.

```{r Figure4-8,fig.cap="(ref:fig4-8)",echo=F,fig.height=4,fig.width=6}
data(ToothGrowth)
require(tibble)
ToothGrowth<-as.tibble(ToothGrowth)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
beanplot(len ~ supp*dose, data=ToothGrowth, side="b", ylim=c(-5,40),
         xlim=c(0.5,3.5),main="Beanplot", col=list("white","orange"),
         xlab="Dosage", ylab="Odontoblast Growth")
legend("bottomright", bty="n", c("VC","OJ"), fill=c("white","orange"))
intplot(len ~ supp*dose, data=ToothGrowth, col=c(1,2), 
        main="Interaction Plot", ylim=c(-5,40),xlim=c(0.5,3.5),cex.main=1,
        cex.leg=0.75,x.leg=2.5,y.leg=5,cex.lab=0.75)
```

```{r eval=F}
data(ToothGrowth)
require(tibble)
ToothGrowth<-as.tibble(ToothGrowth)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
beanplot(len~supp*dose, data=ToothGrowth, side="b", ylim=c(-5,40),
         main="Beanplot", col=list("white","orange"), xlab="Dosage",
         ylab="Tooth Growth")
legend("bottomright", bty="n", c("VC","OJ"), fill=c("white","orange"))
intplot(len~supp*dose, data=ToothGrowth, col=c(1,2), 
        main="Interaction Plot", ylim=c(-5,40))
```

It appears that the effect of method changes based on the dosage as the
interaction plot seems to show some evidence of non-parallel lines. Actually, 
it appears that the effect of delivery method is parallel for doses 0.5 and 1.0
mg/day but that the effect of delivery method changes for 2 mg/day. 

\indent We can use the ANOVA $F$-test for an interaction to assess whether the 
interaction is "real" relative to the variability in the responses. 
That is, is it larger than we would expect due to natural variation in the
data? If yes, then it is a real effect and we should account for it. The
following results fit the interaction model and provide an ANOVA table. 

```{r}
TG1 <- lm(len~supp*dose, data=ToothGrowth)
Anova(TG1)
```

The R output is reporting an interaction test result of $F(1,56)=5.3$ with
a p-value of 0.025. But this should raise a red flag since the numerator 
degrees of freedom are not what we should expect of $(K-1)*(J-1) = (2-1)*(3-1)=2$.
This brings up an issue in R when working
with categorical variables. If the levels of a categorical variable are entered
numerically, R will treat them as quantitative variables and not split out the
different levels of the categorical variable. To make sure that R treats
categorical variables the correct way, we should use the ``factor``
function on any variables that are categorical but are coded numerically in the
data set. The following code creates a new variable called ``dosef``
using the ``factor`` function that will help us obtain correct results from the linear 
model. The re-run of the ANOVA table provides the correct analysis and the 
expected $df$ for the two rows of output involving ``dosef``:

```{r}
ToothGrowth$dosef<-factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
TG2 <- lm(len ~ supp*dosef, data=ToothGrowth)
Anova(TG2)
```

The ANOVA $F$-test for an interaction between supplement type and dosage level is 
$F(2,54)= 4.107$ with a p-value of 0.022. So there is strong evidence of an interaction and we probably should reject the null hypothesis of no interaction between *Dosage* and *Delivery method*,
supporting a changing effect on odontoblast growth of dosage based on the delivery
method in the Guinea Pigs that were assigned. 

\indent Any similarities between this correct
result and the previous WRONG result are coincidence. I once
attended a Master's thesis defense where the results from a similar model were not as
expected (small p-values in places they didn't expect and large p-values in
places where they thought differences existed). During the presentation, the student
showed some ANOVA tables and the four level categorical variable had 1 numerator
$df$ in the ANOVA table. The student
passed with *major* revisions but had to re-run **all** the results and re-write
**all** the conclusions... So be careful to check the ANOVA results ($df$
and for the right number of expected model coefficients) to make
sure they match your expectations. This is one reason why you will be learning
to fill in ANOVA tables based on information about the study so that you can be
prepared to detect when your code has let you down^[Just so you don't think 
that perfect R code should occur on the first try, we
have all made similarly serious coding mistakes even after accumulating more
than decade of experience with R. It is finding those mistakes (in time) that matters.]. It
is also a great reason to explore term-plots and coefficient interpretations as
that can also help diagnose errors in model construction. 

\indent Getting back to the previous results, we now have enough background information 
to more formally write up a
focused interpretation of these results. The 6+ hypothesis testing steps in
this situation would be focused on first identifying that the best analysis
here is as a Two-Way ANOVA situation (these data were analyzed in 
Chapter \@ref(chapter3) as
a One-Way ANOVA but this version is better because it can explore whether there
is an interaction between delivery method and dosage). We will use a 5%
significance level and start with assessing the evidence for an interaction. If
the interaction had been dropped, we would have reported the test results for the
interaction, then re-fit the additive model and used it to explore the main effect
tests and estimates for *Dose* and *Delivery method*.

1. **Hypotheses:**

    * $H_0$: No interaction between *Delivery method* and *Dose* on odontoblast
    growth in population of guinea pigs 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ All $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}=0$.
    
    * $H_A$: Interaction between *Delivery method* and *Dose* on odontoblast
    growth in population of guinea pigs 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ At least one $\omega_{jk}\ne 0$.
    
2. **Validity conditions:**

    * Independence:

        * This assumption is presumed to be met because we don't know of a 
        reason why the independence of the measurements of odontoblast growth of 
        the guinea pigs as studied might be violated. 
        
    * Constant variance:
    
        * To assess this assumption, we can use the diagnostic plots in 
        Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-9). 
        
        * In the Residuals vs Fitted and the Scale-Location plots, the 
        differences in variability among the groups (see the different 
        x-axis positions for each group's fitted values) is minor, so 
        there is not strong evidence of a problem with the equal variance 
        assumption.
        
        ```{r Figure4-9,fig.cap="Diagnostic plots for the interaction model for odontoblast         growth interaction model.",fig.height=5,fig.width=8}
        par(mfrow=c(2,2))
        plot(TG2, pch=16) 
        ```

    * Normality of residuals:
    
        * The QQ-Plot in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-9) does not suggest a 
        problem with this assumption. 
      

3. **Calculate the test statistic for the interaction test.**

    ```{r}
    TG2 <- lm(len~supp*dosef, data=ToothGrowth)
    Anova(TG2) 
    ```

    * The test statistic is $F(2,54)=4.107$.
    
4. **Find the p-value:**

    * The ANOVA $F$-test p-value of 0.0219 for the interaction.
    
    * To find this p-value directly in R from the test statistic value and distribution, we can use the ``pf`` function.
    
    ```{r}
    pf(4.107, df1=2, df2=54, lower.tail=F)
    ```
    
5. **Make a decision:**

    * Reject $H_0$ since the p-value (0.0219) is relatively small (less than 0.05). With a p-value
    of 0.0219, there is about a 2.19% chance we would observe interaction like
    we did (or more extreme) if none were truly present. This provides strong
    evidence against the null hypothesis of no interaction between delivery
    method and dosage on odontoblast growth so we would retain the interaction in the model.
    
6. **Write a conclusion:**

    * Therefore, the effects of dosage level (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/day) on 
    population average tooth odontoblast growth rates of Guinea pigs are changed 
    by the delivery (OJ, Vitamin C) method (and vice versa) and we should keep 
    the interaction in the model. With the random assignment of levels but not 
    random selection of subjects here, we could also write this as: Different 
    dosage levels cause different changes in the odontoblast growth based on the
    delivery method for these guinea pigs.
    
In a Two-Way ANOVA, we need to go a little further to get to the final
interpretations since the models are more complicated. When there is an
interaction present, we should focus on the interaction plot or term-plot of
the interaction model for an interpretation of the form and pattern of the
interaction. If the interaction were unimportant, then the hypotheses and
results should focus on the additive model results, especially the estimated
model coefficients. To see why we don't spend much time with the estimated
model coefficients in an interaction model, the model summary for this model is
provided:

```{r}
summary(TG2)
```

\indent There are two $\omega_{jk}\text{'s}$ in the results, related to modifying the 
estimates for doses of 1 (-0.68) and 2
(5.33) for the Vitamin C group. If you want to re-construct the fitted values
from the model that are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-10), you have 
to look for any
coefficients that are "turned on" for a combination of levels of interest. For
example, for the OJ group (solid line in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-10)), the 
dosage of 0.5 mg/day
has an estimate of an average growth of approximately 13 mm. This is the
baseline group, so the model estimate for an observation in the OJ and 0.5 mg/day
dosage is simply $\hat{y}_{i,\text{OJ},0.5mg}=\hat{\alpha}=13.23$ microns. 
For the OJ and 2 mg dosage estimate that has a value over 25 microns in the
plot, the model incorporates the deviation for the 2 mg dosage:
$\hat{y}_{i,\text{OJ},2mg}=\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\tau}_{2mg}=13.23 + 12.83 = 26.06$
microns. For the Vitamin C group, another coefficient becomes involved from its "main
effect". For the VC and 0.5 mg dosage level, the estimate is approximately 8 microns.
The pertinent model components are 
$\hat{y}_{i,\text{VC},0.5mg}=\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\gamma}_{\text{VC}}=13.23 + (-5.25) = 7.98$
microns. Finally, when we consider non-baseline results for both groups, three
coefficients are required to reconstruct the results in the plot. For example, 
the estimate for the VC, 1 mg dosage is
$\hat{y}_{i,\text{VC},1mg}=\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\tau}_{1mg} + \hat{\gamma}_{\text{VC}}
=13.23 + 9.47 + (-5.25) = 17.45$ microns. We usually will by-pass all this
fun(!) with the coefficients in an interaction model and go from the ANOVA
interaction test to focusing on the pattern of the responses in the interaction
plot, but it is good to know that there are still model coefficients driving
our results.

        cld=T, main="Interaction Plot with CLD")
```

```{r eval=F}
plot(allEffects(TG2), grid=T, multiline=T, ci.style="bars")
```

\indent Given the presence of an important
interaction, then the final step in the interpretation here is to interpret the
results in the interaction plot or term-plot of the interaction model, 
supported by the p-value suggesting evidence of a different effect of
supplement type based on the dosage level. To supplement this even more, 
knowing which combinations of levels differ can enhance our discussion. Tukey's
HSD results (specifically the CLD) can be added to the original interaction
plot by turning on the ``cld=T`` option in the ``intplot`` function as seen in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-11). Sometimes it is hard to see the letters and so
there is also a ``cldshift=...`` option to move the letters up or down, here a 
value of 1 seemed to work. 

```{r eval=F}
intplot(len~supp*dose, data=ToothGrowth, col=c(1,2), cldshift=1,
        cld=T, main="Interaction Plot with CLD")
```

\indent The interpretation of the previous hypothesis test result can be concluded 
with the following discussion. Generally increasing the dosage increases the mean growth except for
the 2 mg/day dosage level where the increase levels off in the OJ group (OJ 1
and 2 mg/day are not detectably different) and the differences between the two 
delivery methods disappear at the highest dosage level. But for 0.5 and 1 mg/day
dosages, OJ is clearly better than VC by about 10 microns of growth on average.

## Observational study example: The Psychology of Debt	{#section4-5}

In this section, the analysis of a survey of $N=464$ randomly sampled
adults will be analyzed from a survey conducted by @Lea1995
and available in the ``debt`` data set from the ``faraway`` package 
[@R-faraway]. The subjects responded to a variety of questions
including whether they buy cigarettes (``cigbuy``: 0 if
no, 1 if yes), their housing situation (``house``: 1 = rent, 2 = mortgage,
and 3 = owned outright), their income group (``incomegp``: 1 =
lowest, 5 = highest), and their score on a continuous scale of attitudes about
debt (``prodebt``: 1 = least favorable, 5 = most favorable). The variable ``prodebt``
was derived as the average of a series of questions about debt with each
question measured on an ***ordinal*** 1 to 5 scale, with higher values 
corresponding to more positive responses about $\underline{\text{going into debt}}$
of various kinds. The ordered scale on surveys that try to elicit your opinions on
topics with scales from 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 or even, sometimes, 1 to 10 is called
a ***Likert scale*** [@Likert1932]. It is not a quantitative scale and really 
should be handled more carefully than taking an average of a set responses. That 
said, it is extremely common practice in social science research to treat ordinal
responses as if they are quantitative and take the average of many of them to
create a more continuous response variable like the one we are using here. If
you continue your statistics explorations, you will see some better techniques
for analyzing responses obtained in this fashion. That said, the scale of the
response is relatively easy to understand as an amount of willingness to go
into debt on a scale from 1 to 5 with higher values corresponding to more
willingness to be in debt. 

\indent This data set is typical of survey data where respondents were not required 
to answer all questions and there are some
missing responses. We will clean out any individuals that failed to respond to
all questions using the ``na.omit`` function, which will return only subjects 
that responded to every question in
the data set. But is this dangerous? Suppose that people did not want to
provide their income levels if they were in the lowest or, maybe, highest
income groups. Then we would be missing responses systematically and conclusions
could be biased because of ignoring these types of subjects. This is another
topic for more advanced statistical methods to try to handle but something
every researcher should worry about when selected subjects do not respond at
all or fail to answer some questions. This ties back into our discussion of who was sampled. We need to
think carefully about who was part of the sample but refused to participate and
how that might impact our inferences. 

\indent Ignoring this potential for bias in the
results for the moment, we are first interested in whether buying
cigarettes/not and income groups interact in their explanation of the
respondent's mean opinions on being in debt. The interaction plot 
(Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-12)) may suggest an interaction between ``cigbuy``
and ``incomegp`` from income levels 1 to 3 where the lines cross but it is 
not as clear as the previous examples. The interaction $F$-test helps us
objectively assess evidence for that interaction. Based on the plot, there do 
not appear to be differences based on cigarette purchasing but there might be some
differences between the income groups. If there is no interaction present, then
this suggests that we might be in Scenario 2 or 3 where a single main effect of
interest is present. 

```{r}
require(faraway)
data(debt)
require(tibble)
debt<-as.tibble(debt)
debt$incomegp <- factor(debt$incomegp)
debt$cigbuy <- factor(debt$cigbuy)
debtc <- na.omit(debt)
```

(ref:fig4-12) Interaction plot of ``prodebt`` by income group and buy cigarettes 
(0=no, 1=yes).

```{r Figure4-12,fig.cap="(ref:fig4-12)",fig.height=5,fig.width=10}
intplot(prodebt~cigbuy*incomegp, data=debtc, col=c(1,3), lwd=2)
```

\indent As in other situations, and especially
with observational studies where a single large sample is analyzed, it is
important to check for balance - whether all the combinations of the two
predictor variables are similarly represented. Even more critically, we need to
check whether all the combinations of levels of factors are measured. If a
combination is not measured, then we lose the ability to estimate the mean for
that combination and the ability to test for an interaction. A solution to that
problem would be to collapse the categories of one of the variables, changing
the definitions of the levels but if you fail to obtain information for all
combinations, you can't work with the interaction model. In this situation, we
barely have enough information to proceed (the smallest $n_{jk}$ is 8 for 
income group 4 that buys cigarettes). We have a very unbalanced design
with counts between 8 and 51 in the different combinations. 

```{r}
tally(cigbuy~incomegp, data=debtc)
```

\indent The test for the interaction is always
how we start our modeling in Two-Way ANOVA situations. The ANOVA table suggests
that there is little evidence of interaction between the income level and
buying cigarettes on the opinions of the respondents towards debt 
($F(4,294)=1.0003$, p-value=0.408). This suggests that the initial assessment 
that the interaction wasn't too prominent
was correct. We should move to the additive model here but first need to check
the assumptions to make sure we can trust this initial test. 

```{r}
require(car)
debt1 <- lm(prodebt ~ incomegp*cigbuy, data=debtc)
Anova(debt1)
```

The diagnostic plots (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-13)) seem to be pretty 
well-behaved with no apparent
violations of the normality assumption and no clear evidence of a violation of
the constant variance assumption. The observations would seem to be independent
because there is no indication of structure to the measurements of the survey
respondents that might create dependencies. In observational studies, violations
of the independence assumption might come from repeated measures of the same
person or multiple measurements within the same family/household or samples
that are clustered geographically. The random sampling from a population should
allow inferences to a larger population except for that issue of removing
partially missing responses. We also don't have much information on the
population sampled, so will just leave this vague here but know that there is a
population these conclusions apply to since it was random sample. All of this
suggests proceeding to fitting and exploring the additive model is reasonable
here. No causal inferences are possible because this is an observational study. 

(ref:fig4-13) Diagnostic plot for ``prodebt`` by income group and buy 
cigarettes/not interaction model.

```{r Figure4-13,fig.cap="(ref:fig4-13)",fig.height=5,fig.width=8}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

```
 
1. **Hypotheses (Two sets apply when the additive model is the focus!):**

    * $H_0$: No difference in means for ``prodebt`` for income groups in 
    population, given cigarette buying in model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ All $\tau_j\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model. 
    
    * $H_A$: Some difference in means for ``prodebt`` for income group in 
    population, given cigarette buying in model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ Not all $\tau_j\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model. 
    
    * $H_0$: No difference in means for ``prodebt`` for cigarette 
    buying/not in population, given income group in model </span>

        $\Leftrightarrow$ All $\gamma_k\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model. 
    
    * $H_A$: Some difference in means for ``prodebt`` for cigarette 
    buying/not in population, given income group in model 
    
        $\Leftrightarrow$ Not all $\gamma_k\text{'s} = 0$ in additive model. 
    
2. **Validity conditions -- discussed above but with new plots for the additive model:**

    ```{r Figure4-14,fig.cap="Diagnostic plot for ``prodebt`` by income group and buy   cigarettes/not",fig.height=5,fig.width=8}
    debt1r <- lm(prodebt~incomegp+cigbuy, data=debtc)
    par(mfrow=c(2,2))
    plot(debt1r)
    ```

    * Constant Variance:
    
        * In the Residuals vs Fitted and the Scale-Location plots in 
        Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-14), the differences in variability among 
        groups is minor and nothing suggests a violation. **If you change
        models, you should always revisit the diagnostic plots to make sure you 
        didn't create problems that were not present in more complicated models.** 

    * Normality of residuals:
    
        * The QQ-Plot in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-14) does not suggest 
        a problem with this assumption. 

3. **Calculate the test statistic for the two main effect tests.**

    ```{r}
    Anova(debt1r)
    ```

    * The test statistics are $F(4,298)=4.577$ and $F(1,298)=1.427$. 
    
4. **Find the p-value:**

    * The ANOVA $F$-test p-values are 0.001335 for the income group 
    variable (conditional on cigarette buy) and 0.2232 for
    the cigarette buy variable (conditional on income group). 
    
5. **Make decisions:**

    * Reject $H_0$ of no income group differences (p-value=0.0013) and fail to
    reject $H_0$ of no cigarette buying differences (p-value=0.2232), 
    each after controlling for the other variable. 
    
6. **Write a conclusion:**

    * There was initially no evidence to support retaining the interaction 
    of income group and cigarette buying on pro-debt feelings 
    ($F(4,294)=1.00, \text{p-value} =0.408$) so the interaction was dropped 
    from the model. There is strong evidence of some difference in the mean
    pro-debt feelings in the population across the income groups, after
    adjusting for cigarette buying. There is little to no evidence of a
    difference in the mean pro-debt feelings in the population based on
    cigarette buying/not, after adjusting for income group. 

\indent So we learned that the additive model
was more appropriate for these responses and that the results resemble Scenario
2 or 3 with only one main effect being important. In the additive model, the
coefficients can be interpreted as shifts from the baseline after controlling
for the other variable in the model. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-15) shows the 
increasing average
comfort with being in debt as the income groups go up. Being a cigarette buyer
was related to a lower comfort level with debt. But compare the y-axis scales
in the two plots -- the differences in the means across income groups are almost
0.5 points on a 5 point scale whereas the difference across ``cigbuy``'s
two levels is less than 0.15 units. The error bars for the 95% confidence
intervals are of similar width but the differences in means show up clearly in
the income group term-plot. This is all indirectly related to the size of the
p-values for each term in the additive model but hopefully helps to build some
intuition on the reason for differences. 

(ref:fig4-15) Term-plots for the ``prodebt`` response additive model with left 
panel for income group and the right panel for buying cigarettes or not
(1 for yes).

```{r Figure4-15,fig.cap="(ref:fig4-15)",fig.height=5,fig.width=10}
plot(allEffects(debt1r))
```

\newpage

\indent The estimated coefficients can also be
interesting to interpret for the additive model. Here are the model summary coefficients:

```{r}
summary(debt1r)$coefficients
```

In the model, the baseline group is for non-cigarette buyers (``cigbuy=0``)
and income group 1 with $\hat{\alpha}= 3.055$ points. Regardless of the 
``cigbuy`` level, the difference between income groups 2 and 1 is estimated
to be $\hat{\tau}_2=0.016$, an increase in the mean score of 0.016 points. 
Similarly, the difference between income groups 3 and 1 is $\hat{\tau}_3=0.175$
points, regardless of cigarette smoking status. The estimated difference
between cigarette buyers and non-buyers was estimated as 
$\hat{\gamma}_2=-0.106$ points for any income group, remember that this 
variable had a moderately
large p-value in this model. The additive model-based estimates for all 
six combinations can be found in Table \@ref(tab:Table4-3).

\indent One final plot of the fitted values
from this additive model in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-16) hopefully crystallizes
the implications
of an additive model and reinforces that this model creates and assumes that
the differences across levels of one variable are the same regardless of the
level of the other variable and that this creates parallel lines. The
difference between ``cigbuy`` levels across all income groups is a drop in 
-0.106 points. The income groups
have the same differences regardless of cigarette buying or not, with income
group 5 much higher than the other four groups. 

(ref:fig4-16) Illustration of the results from Table \@ref(tab:Table4-2)

Panel (b) displays the different income groups as lines with the cigarette
buying status on the x-axis.

**In general, we proceed through the following steps in any 2-WAY ANOVA situation:**

1. Make an interaction plot. 

2. Fit the interaction model; examine the test for the interaction. 

3. Check the residual diagnostic plots for the interaction model (especially
normality and equal variance). 

    * If there is a problem with normality or
    equal variance, consider a "transformation" of the response as discussed in
    Chapter \@ref(chapter7) This can help make the responses have similar 
    variances or responses to be more normal, but sometimes not both. 

4. If the interaction test has a small p-value, that is your main result. Focus on
the interaction plot from (1) to fully understand the results, adding Tukey's
HSD results to see which means of the combinations of levels are detected as
being different. 

5. If the interaction is not considered important, then re-fit the model without
the interaction (additive model) and re-check the diagnostic plots. If the
diagnostics are reasonable to proceed:

    * Focus on the results for each explanatory
    variable, using Type II tests especially if the design is not balanced. 
    
    * Report the initial interaction test
    results and the results for the test for each variable from the model 
    that is re-fit without the interaction. 
    
    * Model coefficients are interesting as they are shifts from baseline 
    for each level of each variable, controlling for the other variable -- 
    interpret those differences if the number of levels is not
    too great. 
    
Whether you end up favoring an additive or interaction model, all steps of the
hypothesis testing protocol should be engaged and a story based on the final results should be compiled, supported by the graphical displays. 

## Pushing Two-Way ANOVA to the limit: Un-replicated designs	{#section4-6}

\indent In some situations, it is too expensive
to replicate combinations of treatments and only one observation at each
combination of the two explanatory variables, A and B, is possible. In these
situations, even though we have information about all combinations of A and B, 
it is no longer possible to test for an interaction. Our regular rules for
degrees of freedom show that we have nothing left for the error degrees of
freedom and so we have to drop the interaction and call that potential
interaction variability "error". 

\indent We can still perform an analysis of the
responses but an issue occurs with trying to estimate the interaction 
$F$-test statistic -- we run out of degrees of freedom for the error. To 
illustrate these methods, the paper towel example
is revisited except that only one response for each combination is used. Now
the entire data set can be displayed:

```{r}
ptR <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/ptR.csv")
ptR$dropsf <- factor(ptR$drops)
ptR
```


Upon first inspection the interaction plot in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-17)
looks like there might be
some interesting interactions present. But remember now that there is only a
single observation at each combination of the brands and water levels so there
is not much power to detect differences in this sort of situation and no replicates
at any combinations of levels that allow estimation of SEs so no bands are produced in the
plot. 

(ref:fig4-17) Interaction plot in paper towel data set with no replication. 

```{r Figure4-17,fig.cap="(ref:fig4-17)",echo=F,fig.height=2.75}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
old.par <- par(mai=c(0.85,1,0.5,1))
intplot(responses~brand*dropsf,data=ptR,lwd=2,cex.main=0.75,cex.lab=0.75,
        x.leg=2.6, y.leg=2.85)
```

```{r eval=F}
intplot(responses~brand*dropsf, data=ptR, lwd=2)
```

\indent The next step would be to assess the
statistical evidence related to an interaction between ``Brand`` and 
``Drops``. A problem will arise in trying to form the ANOVA table as you 
would see this when you run the ``anova``^[We switched back to the ``anova`` function here as the ``Anova`` function only reports ``Error in Anova.lm(lm(responses ~ dropsf * brand, data = ptR)) : 
  residual df = 0``, which is fine but not as useful for understanding as what ``anova`` provides.] function on the interaction model:

\small

```
> anova(lm(responses~dropsf*brand,data=ptR))
Analysis of Variance Table
Response: responses
             Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)
dropsf        2 2.03872 1.01936               
brand         1 0.80663 0.80663

Warning message:
In anova.lm(lm(responses ~ dropsf * brand, data = ptR)) :
  ANOVA F-tests on an essentially perfect fit are unreliable
```

\normalsize

Warning messages in R output show up after you run functions that contain
problems and are generally not a good thing, but can sometimes be ignored. In
this case, the warning message is not needed -- there are no $F$-statistics or 
p-values in the results so we know there are some issues with the results. The 
**Residuals** line is key here -- Residuals with 0 *df* and sums of
squares of 0. Without replication, there are no degrees of freedom left to 
estimate the residual error. My first statistics professor, 
Gordon Bril at Luther College, used to refer to this as "shooting your load" by
fitting too many terms in the model given the number of observations available. 
Maybe this is a bit graphic but hopefully will help you remember the need for
replication if you want to estimate interactions -- it did for me. Without
replication of observations, we run out of information to estimate and test all
the desired model components. 

\indent So what can we do if we can't afford replication but want to study two variables in the same study? We can *assume* that the 
interaction does not exist and use those degrees of freedom and variability as 
the error variability. When we drop the interaction from Two-Way
models, the interaction variability is added into the $\text{SS}_E$
so this is interaction between the variables. We are not able to test for an 
interaction so must rely on the interaction plot to assess whether an interaction 
might be present. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-17) suggests there might be an 
interaction in these data (the
two brands lines cross noticeably suggesting non-parallel lines). So in this
case, assuming no interaction is present is hard to justify. But if we proceed
under this dangerous and untestable assumption, tests for the main effects can be developed. 

\newpage

```{r}
norep1 <- lm(responses~dropsf+brand, data=ptR)
Anova(norep1)
```

In the additive model, the last row of the ANOVA table that is called the 
``Residuals`` row is really the interaction row from the interaction model 
ANOVA table. Neither main effect had a small p-value 
(*Drops*: $F(2,2)=0.82, \text{ p-value}=0.55$ and 
*Brand*: $F(1,2)=0.65, \text{ p-value}=0.51$) in the additive model. To 
get small p-values with the small sample sizes that unreplicated designs would generate, the differences would need to be
**very** large because the residual degrees of freedom have become very small.
The term-plots in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure4-18) show that the
differences among the levels are small relative to the residual variability as
seen in the error bars around each point estimate.

replication.

```

\indent Hopefully by pushing the limits there
are two conclusions available from this section. First, replication is
important, both in being able to perform tests for interactions and for having
enough power to detect differences for the main effects. Second, when dropping 
from the interaction model to additive model, the variability explained by the
interaction term is pushed into the error term, whether replication is
available or not.

## Chapter summary	{#section4-7}

\indent In this chapter, methods for handling two different categorical predictors 
in the same model with a
continuous response were developed. The methods build on techniques from
Chapter \@ref(chapter3) for the One-Way ANOVA and there are connections 
between the two
models. This was most clearly seen in the guinea pig data set that was analyzed
in both chapters. When two factors are available, it is better to start with
the methods developed in this chapter because the interaction between the
factors can, potentially, be separated from their main effects. The additive
model is easier to interpret but should only be used when no evidence of an
interaction is present. When an interaction is determined to be present, the
main effects should not be interpreted and the interaction plot in combination
with Tukey's HSD provides information on the important aspects of the results. 

* If the interaction is retained in the model, there are two things you want 
to do with interpreting the interaction:

    1. Describe the interaction, going through the changes from left to right 
    in the interaction plot or term-plot for each level of the other variable. 
    
    2. Suggest optimal and worst combinations of the two variables to describe the highest and lowest possible estimated mean responses. 
    
        a. For example, you might want to identify a dosage and delivery 
        method for the guinea pigs to recommend and one to avoid if you 
        want to optimize odontoblast growth. 
        
* If there is no interaction, then the additive model provides information 
on each of the variables and the differences across levels of each variable 
are the same regardless of the levels of the other variable. 

    * You can describe the deviations from baseline as in Chapter \@ref(chapter3),
    but for each variable, noting that you are controlling for the variable. 

\indent Some statisticians might have different
recommendations for dealing with interactions and main effects, especially in
the context of evidence of an interaction. We have chosen to focus on tests for
interactions to screen for "real" interactions and then interpret the
interaction plots aided by the Tukey's HSD for determining which combinations
of levels are detectably different. Some suggest exploring the main
effects tests even with interactions present. In some cases, those results are
interesting but in others the results can be misleading and we wanted to avoid
trying to parse out the scenarios when it might be safe to focus on the main effects in the presence of important interactions. Consider two scenarios, one where
the main effects have large p-values but the interaction has a small p-value
and the other where the main effects and the interaction all have small
p-values. The methods discussed in this chapter allow us to effectively arrive
at the interpretation of the differences in the results across the combinations
of the treatments due to the interaction having a small p-value. The main
effects results are secondary results at best when the interaction is important
because we know that impacts of one explanatory variable is changing based on
the levels of the other variable. 

\indent Chapter \@ref(chapter5) presents a bit of a different set of statistical 
methods that allow analyses of data sets similar
to those considered in the last two chapters but with a categorical response
variable. The methods are very different in application but are quite similar in overall goals
to those in Chapter \@ref(chapter3) where differences in responses where explored 
across groups. After Chapter \@ref(chapter5), the rest of the semester will 
return to fitting models using the ``lm`` function as used here, but 
incorporating quantitative predictor variables and
then eventually incorporating both categorical and quantitative predictor
variables. The methods in Chapter \@ref(chapter8) are actually quite similar 
to those considered here, so the better you understand these models, the easier that material will be master. 

## Important R code	{#section4-8}

The main components of R code used in this chapter follow with components to 
modify in lighter and/or ALL CAPS text, remembering that any R
packages mentioned need to be installed and loaded for this code to have a
chance of working:

* **tally(`r colFmt("A","red")`~`r colFmt("B","red")`,
data=`r colFmt("DATASETNAME","red")`)**

    * Requires the ``mosaic`` package be loaded. 
    
    * Provides the counts of observations in each combination of categorical 
    predictor variables A and B, used to check for balance and understand sample 
    sizes in each combination. 
    
* **`r colFmt("DATASETNAME","red")`&#36;`r colFmt("VARIABLENAME","red")` ``<-`` 
factor(`r colFmt("DATASETNAME","red")`&#36;`r colFmt("VARIABLENAME","red")`)**

    * Use the ``factor`` function on any numerically coded
    explanatory variable where the numerical codes represent levels of a
    categorical variable. 
    
* **intplot(`r colFmt("Y","red")`~`r colFmt("A","red")`*`r colFmt("B","red")`,
data=`r colFmt("DATASETNAME","red")`)**

    * Download and install using: 
    
        ``source("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/intplot.R")``
    
    * Provides interaction plot.
    
* **`r colFmt("INTERACTIONMODELNAME","red")` ``<-`` 
lm(`r colFmt("Y","red")`~`r colFmt("A","red")`*`r colFmt("B","red")`,
data=`r colFmt("DATASETNAME","red")`)**

    * Fits the interaction model with main effects for A and B and an 
    interaction between them.
    
    * This is the first model that should be fit in Two-Way ANOVA 
    modeling situations.
    
* **`r colFmt("ADDITIVEMODELNAME","red")` ``<-``
lm(`r colFmt("Y","red")`~`r colFmt("A","red")`+`r colFmt("B","red")`,
data=`r colFmt("DATASETNAME","red")`)**

    * Fits the additive model with only main effects for A and B but no 
    interaction between them.
    
    * Should only be used if the interaction has been decided to be 
    unimportant using a test for the interaction.
    
* **summary(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`)**

    * Generates model summary information including the estimated model coefficients, 
    SEs, t-tests, and p-values. 

* **Anova(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`)**

    * Requires the ``car`` package to be loaded.
    
    * Generates a Type II Sums of Squares ANOVA table that is useful for 
    both additive and interaction models, but it most important to use 
    when working with the additive model as it provides inferences for 
    each term conditional on the other one. 

* **par(mfrow=c(2,2)); plot(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`)**

    * Generates four diagnostic plots including the Residuals vs Fitted and 
    Normal Q-Q plot. 
    
* **plot(allEffects(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`))**
    
    * Requires the ``effects`` package be loaded. 

    * Plots the results from the estimated model.

## Practice problems	{#section4-9}

To practice the Two-Way ANOVA, consider a data set on $N=861$ ACT
Mathematics Usage Test scores from 1987. The test was given to a 
sample of high school seniors who met one of three profiles of high school 
mathematics course
work: (a) Algebra I only; (b) two Algebra courses and Geometry; and (c) two
Algebra courses, Geometry, Trigonometry, Advanced Mathematics, and Beginning
Calculus. These data were generated from summary statistics for one particular
form of the test as reported by @Doolittle1989. The source of this version of
the data set is @Ramsey2012 and the ``Sleuth2`` package 
[@R-Sleuth2]. 
First install and then load that package. 

```
require(Sleuth2)
require(mosaic)
require(tibble)
math <- as.tibble(ex1320)
math
names(math)
favstats(Score ~ Sex+Background, data=math)
``` 

4.1. Use the ``favstats`` summary to discuss whether the design was balanced or not. 

4.2. Make a side-by-side beanplot and
interaction plot of the results and discuss the relationship between Sex, 
Background, and ACT Score. 

4.3. Write out the interaction model in
terms of the Greek letters, making sure to define all the terms and don't
forget the error terms in the model. 

4.4. Fit the interaction plot and find
the ANOVA table. For the test you should consider first (the interaction), 
write out the hypotheses, report the test statistic, p-value, distribution of
the test statistic under the null, and write a conclusion related to the
results of this test. 

4.5. Re-fit the model as an additive
model (why is this reasonable here?) and use ``Anova`` to find the Type II sums of
squares ANOVA. Write out the hypothesis for the Background variable, report the
test statistic, p-value, distribution of the test statistic under the null, and
write a conclusion related to the results of this test. Make sure to discuss the scope of inference for this result.

4.6. Use the ``effects`` package to make a term-plot from the
additive model from 4.5 and discuss the results. Specifically, discuss what you
can conclude about the average relationship across both sexes, between
Background and average ACT score?

4.7. Make our standard diagnostic plots
and assess the assumptions using these plots. Can you assess independence using
these plots? Discuss this assumption in this situation. 

4.8. Use the estimated model
coefficients to determine which of the combinations of levels provides the
highest estimated average score.
