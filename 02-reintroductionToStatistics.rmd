The previous material served to get us started in R and to get a quick review of same basic
descriptive statistics. Now we will begin to engage some new material and
exploit the power of R to do some statistical inference. Because inference is
one of the hardest topics to master in statistics, we will also review some
basic terminology that is required to move forward in learning more
sophisticated statistical methods. To keep this "review" as short as possible, 
we will not consider every situation you learned in introductory statistics and
instead focus exclusively on the situation where we have a quantitative
response variable measured on two groups, adding a new graphic called a "bean
plot" to help us see the differences in the observations in the groups. 

##Histograms, boxplots, and density curves {#section2-1}

Part of learning statistics is learning to correctly use the terminology, some of which is used colloquially
differently than it is used in formal statistical settings. The most commonly
"misused" statistical term is ***data***. In statistical parlance, we want to note the plurality of
data. Specifically, ***datum*** is a single measurement, possibly on multiple random
variables, and so it is appropriate to say that "**a datum is...**". 
Once we move to discussing data, we are now referring to more than one 
observation, again on one, or possibly more than one, random variable, and 
so we need to use "**data are...**" when talking about our observations. We want 
to distinguish our use of the term "data" from its more
colloquial^[You will more typically hear "data is" but that more often refers to
information, sometimes even statistical summaries of data sets, than to
observations collected as part of a study, suggesting the confusion of this
term in the general public. We will explore a data set in Chapter \@ref(chapter5)
related to perceptions of this issue collected by researchers at
http://fivethirtyeight.com/.] usage that often involves treating it as singular. 
In a statistical setting
"data" refers to measurements of our cases or units. When we summarize the
results of a study (say providing the mean and SD), that information is not
"data". We used our data to generate that information. Sometimes we also use
the term "data set" to refer to all our observations and this is a singular
term to refer to the group of observations and this makes it really easy to
make mistakes on the usage of "data"^[Either try to remember "data is a plural word" or replace "data" with "things" in your sentence and consider whether it sounds right.]. 

\indent It is also really important to note that ***variables*** have to vary --
if you measure the sex of your subjects but are only measuring females, then you do
not have a "variable". You may not know if you have real variability in a
"variable" until you explore the results you obtained. 

\indent The last, but probably most important, aspect of data is the context 
of the measurement. The "who, what, when, and where" of the collection 
of the observations is critical to the
sort of conclusions we can make based on the results. The information on the
study design provides information required to assess the scope of inference of
the study. Generally, remember to think about the research questions the
researchers were trying to answer and whether their study actually would answer
those questions. There are no formulas to help us sort some of these things
out, just critical thinking about the context of the measurements. 

\indent To make this concrete, consider the data collected from a study 
[@Plaster1989] to investigate whether
perceived physical attractiveness had an impact on the sentences or perceived
seriousness of a crime that male jurors might give to female defendants. The
researchers showed the participants in the study (men who volunteered from a
prison) pictures of one of three young women. Each picture had previously been
decided to be either beautiful, average, or unattractive by the researchers. 
Each "juror" was randomly assigned to one of three levels of this factor (which
is a categorical *predictor* or *explanatory* variable) and then each participant rated their
picture on a variety of traits such as how warm or sincere the woman appeared. 
Finally, they were told the women had committed a crime (also randomly assigned
to either be told she committed a burglary or a swindle) and were asked to rate
the seriousness of the crime and provide a suggested length of sentence. We
will bypass some aspects of their research and just focus on differences in the
sentence suggested among the three pictures. To get a sense of these data, 
let's consider the first and last parts of the data set:

(ref:tab2-1) First 5 and last 7 rows of the Mock Jury data set.

```{r Table2-1,echo=F,results="asis"}
column.headers = c("Subject","Attr","Crime","Years","Serious","Independent","Sincere")
row1 <- c(1,"Beautiful","Burglary",10,8,9,8)
row2 <- c(2,"Beautiful","Burglary",3,8,9,3)
row3 <- c(3,"Beautiful","Burglary",5,5,6,3)
row4 <- c(4,"Beautiful","Burglary",1,3,9,8)
row5 <- c(5,"Beautiful","Burglary",7,9,5,1)
row6 <- c("...","...","...","...","...",
          "...","...")
row7 <- c(108,"Average","Swindle",3,3,5,4)
row8 <- c(109,"Average","Swindle",3,2,9,9)
row9 <- c(110,"Average","Swindle",2,1,8,8)
row10 <- c(111,"Average","Swindle",7,4,9,1)
row11 <- c(112,"Average","Swindle",6,3,5,2)
row12 <- c(113,"Average","Swindle",12,9,9,1)
row13 <- c(114,"Average","Swindle",8,8,1,5)
x <- matrix(c(row1,row2,row3,row4,row5,row6,row7,row8,row9,row10,row11,row12,row13),
            byrow=T,ncol=7)
m <- as.data.frame(x)
colnames(m) <- column.headers
pandoc.table(m,caption="(\\#tab:Table2-1) (ref:tab2-1)", keep.line.breaks = TRUE, split.table = Inf)
```

\indent When working with data, we should always start with 
summarizing the sample size. We will use ***n*** for the 
number of subjects in the sample and denote the population size (if
available) with ***N***. Here, the sample size is ***n=114***. In
this situation, we do not have a random sample from a population 
(these were volunteers from the population of prisoners at the
particular prison) so we cannot make inferences from our sample to a larger group. 
But we can assess whether there is a ***causal effect***^[As noted previously, we reserve the term "effect" for situations where random assignment allows us to consider causality as the reason for the differences in the response variable among levels of the explanatory variable, but this is only the case if we find evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference
in the groups.]: if sufficient evidence is found to conclude that there is some difference in
the responses across the treated groups, we can attribute those differences to
the treatments applied, since the groups should be same otherwise due to the
pictures being randomly assigned to the "jurors". The story of the data set --
that it was collected on prisoners -- becomes pretty important in thinking about
the ramifications of any results. Are male prisoners different from the
population of college males or all residents of a state such as Montana? If so, 
then we should not assume that the detected differences, if detected, would
also exist in some other group of male subjects. The lack of a random sample
makes it impossible to assume that this set of prisoners might be like other
prisoners. So there are definite limitations to the inferences in the following
results. But it is still interesting to see if the pictures caused a difference
in the suggested mean sentences, even though the inferences are limited to this
group of prisoners. If this had been an observational study (suppose that the
prisoners could select one of the three pictures), then we would have to avoid
any of the "causal" language that we can consider here because the pictures
were not randomly assigned to the subjects. Without random assignment, the
explanatory variable of picture choice could be ***confounded*** with  another characteristic of prisoners that was related to which picture they selected and
the rating they provided. Confounding is not the only reason to avoid causal
statements with non-random assignment but the inability to separate the effect
of other variables (measured or unmeasured) from the differences we are
observing means that our inferences in these situations need to be carefully
stated to avoid implying causal effects. 

\indent Instead of loading this data set into R using the "Import Dataset" 
functionality, we can load an R
package that contains the data, making for easy access to this data set. The
package called ``heplots`` [@R-heplots] contains a data set called ``MockJury`` 
that contains the results of the study. We also rely on the R package called 
``mosaic`` [@R-mosaic] that was introduced previously. First (but only once), 
you need to install both packages, which can
be done either using the Packages tab in the lower right panel of RStudio or
using the ``install.packages`` function with quotes around the package name:

```r
> install.packages("heplots")
```

After making sure that both packages are installed, we use the ``require`` 
function around the package name (no quotes now!) to load the package, something that
you need to do any time you want to use features of a package. 

```{r message=F,warning=F}
require(heplots)
require(mosaic)
```


\indent When you are loading a package, R might mention a need to install other packages. If the output says that it needs a package that is
unavailable, then follow the same process noted above to install that package
and then repeat trying to load the package you wanted. These are called package "dependencies" and are due to one package developer relying on functions that already exist in another package. 

\indent To load the data set that is available in an active package, we use the 
``data`` function. 

```{r}
data(MockJury)
```

\indent Some data sets, like this one, will load in a different data set framework
called a "data frame" (its class in R is "data.frame"). You can leave it in this
format but for consistency of output, we will change it to a *tibble* using the
``as.tibble`` function in the code that follows. Now there will be a tibble called
``MockJury`` available for us to 
analyze and some information about it in the **Environment** tab. Again, we 
can find out more about the data set in a couple of ways. First, 
we can use the ``View`` function to provide a spreadsheet type of display 
in the upper left panel. Second, we can use the ``head`` and ``tail`` 
functions to print out the beginning and end of the data set.  

```{r eval=F}
require(tibble)
MockJury<-as.tibble(MockJury)
View(MockJury)
head(MockJury)
```

```{r echo=F}
head(MockJury)
```

```{r}
tail(MockJury)
```

When data sets are loaded from packages, there is often extra documentation
available about the data set which can be accessed using the ``help`` function. In
this case, it will bring up a screen with information about the study and each
variable that was measured. 

```{r eval=F}
help(MockJury)
```

The ``help`` function is also useful with functions in R to help you 
understand options and, at the bottom of the help, 
see examples of using the function. 

\indent With many variables in a data set, it is often useful to get some 
quick information about all of them; the ``summary`` function provides 
useful information whether the variables are categorical or 
quantitative and notes if any values were missing. 

```{r}
summary(MockJury)
```

If we take a few moments to explore the output we can discover some 
useful aspects of the data set. The output is organized by variable, 
providing summary information based on the type of
variable, either counts by category for categorical variables (``Attr`` 
and ``Crime``) or the 5-number summary plus the mean for quantitative 
variables. If present, you would also get a count of missing values that are
called "NAs" in R. For the first variable, called ``Attr`` in the data.frame 
and that we might more explicitly name *Attractiveness*, we find counts of the 
number of subjects shown each picture: $37$ out of $114$ viewed the 
"Unattractive" picture, $38$ viewed "Average", and $39$ viewed "Beautiful". 
We can also see that suggested prison sentences (variable 
``Years``) ranged from 1 year to 15 years with a median of 3 years. 
It seems that all the other variables except for *Crime* (type of crime 
that they were told the pictured woman committed) contained responses 
between 1 and 9 based on rating scales from 1 = low to 9 = high.

\indent To accompany the numerical summaries, histograms and boxplots can 
provide some initial information on the shape of the distribution of 
the responses for the suggested sentences in *Years*. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-1)
contains the histogram 
and boxplot of *Years*, ignoring any information on which picture the 
"jurors" were shown. The calls to the two plotting functions are 
enhanced slightly to add better labels. 

(ref:fig2-1) Histogram and boxplot of suggested sentences in years.

```{r Figure2-1, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-1)",echo=F,fig.height=4,fig.width=6,cache=T}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(MockJury$Years, xlab="Years", labels=T, main="Histogram of Years",
     ylim=c(0,43))
boxplot(MockJury$Years, ylab="Years", main="Boxplot of Years")
```

```{r eval=F}
hist(MockJury$Years, xlab="Years", labels=T, main="Histogram of Years")
boxplot(MockJury$Years, ylab="Years", main="Boxplot of Years")
```

The distribution appears to have a strong right skew with three 
observations at 15 years flagged as potential
outliers. You can only tell that there are three observations and that they are
at 15 by looking at both plots -- the bar around 15 years in the histogram has a
count of three and the boxplot only shows a single point at 15 which is
actually three tied points at exactly 15 years plotted on top of each other (we
call this "overplotting"). These three observations really seem to be the upper
edge of the overall pattern of a strongly right skewed distribution, so even
though they are flagged in the boxplot, they really are not outside the pattern we observed so are not outliers. In real data sets, outliers are commonly encountered and the
first step is to verify that they were not errors in recording (if so, fixing or removing them is easily justified). If they cannot be easily dismissed or fixed, the next step
is to study their impact on the statistical analyses performed, potentially
considering reporting results with and without the influential observation(s)
in the results. If the analysis is unaffected by the "unusual" observations, 
then it matters little whether they are dropped or not. If they do affect the
results, then reporting both versions of results allows the reader to judge the
impacts for themselves. It is important to remember that sometimes the outliers
are the most interesting part of the data set. 

\indent Often when statisticians think of distributions of data, we think 
of the smooth underlying
shape that led to the data set that is being displayed in the histogram. 
Instead of binning up observations and making bars in the histogram, we can
estimate what is called a ***density curve*** as a smooth curve 
that represents the observed distribution of the responses. Density curves can
sometimes help us see features of the data sets more clearly. 

\indent To understand the density curve, it is useful to initially see 
the histogram and density curve together. The height of the density curve is scaled 
so that the total area under the curve^[If you've taken calculus, you will 
know that the 
curve is being constructed so that the integral from $-\infty$ to 
$\infty$ is 1. If you don't know calculus, think of a rectangle with area 
of 1 based on its height and width. These cover the same area but the top of the 
region wiggles.] is 1. To make a comparable histogram, the 
y-axis needs to be scaled so that the histogram is also on the "density" 
scale which makes the bar heights adjust so that the proportion of the 
total data set in each bar is represented by the area in each bar 
(remember that area is height times width). So the height depends on the 
width of the bars and the total area across all the bars has to be 1. In the 
``hist`` function, the ``freq=F`` option does this required re-scaling to get
density-scaled histogram bars. The 
density curve is added to the histogram using the R code of 
``lines(density())``, producing the result in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-2) with 
added modifications of options for ``lwd`` (line width) and ``col`` (color)
to make the plot more interesting. You can see how the density curve 
somewhat matches the histogram bars but deals with the bumps up and down 
and edges a little differently. We can pick out the strong right skew using 
either display and will rarely make both together. 

(ref:fig2-2) Histogram and density curve of Years data.


```{r Figure2-2, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-2)",cache=T}
hist(MockJury$Years, freq=F, xlab="Years", main="Histogram of Years")
lines(density(MockJury$Years), lwd=3,col="red")
```

\indent Histograms can be sensitive to the choice of the number of bars and 
even the cut-offs used to define the bins for a given number of bars.
Small changes in the definition of cut-offs for the bins can have 
noticeable impacts on the shapes observed but
this does not impact density curves. We are not going to tinker with the
default choices for bars in histogram as they are reasonably selected, but we
can add information on the original observations being included in each bar to
better understand the choices that ``hist`` is making. In the previous 
display, we can add what is called a ***rug*** to the plot, where a tick 
mark is made on the x-axis for each observation. Because the responses 
were provided as whole years (1, 2, 3, ..., 15), we need to use a graphical 
technique called ***jittering*** to add a little noise^[Jittering typically 
involves adding random variability to each observation that
is uniformly distributed in a range determined based on the spacing of the
observation. This means that if you re-run the ``jitter`` function, the results will change. 
For more details, type ``help(jitter)`` in the console in RStudio.] to each observation so all the
observations at each year value do not 
plot as a single line. In Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-3), the added tick marks 
on the x-axis show the approximate locations of the original observations. 
We can see how there are 3 observations at 15 (all were 15 and the noise 
added makes it possible to see them all). The limitations of the 
histogram arise around the 10 year sentence
area where there are many responses at 10 years and just one at both 9 and 11 years, 
but the histogram bars sort of miss this aspect of the data set. The
density curve did show a small bump at 10 years. Density curves are, however, 
not perfect and this one shows area for sentences less than 0 years which is
not possible here. 

(ref:fig2-3) Histogram with density curve and rug plot of the jittered responses. 

```{r Figure2-3, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-3)",cache=T}
hist(MockJury$Years, freq=F, xlab="Years",
     main="Histogram of Years with density curve and rug")
lines(density(MockJury$Years), lwd=3, col="red")
rug(jitter(MockJury$Years), col="blue", lwd=2)
```
 
\indent The graphical tools we've just discussed are going to help us move to comparing the
distribution of responses across more than one group. We will have two displays
that will help us make these comparisons. The simplest is 
the ***side-by-side boxplot***, where a boxplot is displayed for each group 
of interest using the same y-axis scaling. In R, we can use its ***formula***
notation to see if the response (``Years``) differs based on the group 
(``Attr``) by using something like ``Y~X`` or, here, ``Years~Attr``. 
We also need to tell R where to find the variables -- use the last option in the command, ``data=DATASETNAME`` , to inform R of the tibble to look in 
to find the variables. In this example, ``data=MockJury``. We will use 
the formula and ``data=...`` options in almost every function we use
from here forward. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-4) contains the side-by-side 
boxplots showing right skew for all the groups, slightly higher median and 
more variability for the *Unattractive* group along with some potential outliers indicated in two of the three groups. 

(ref:fig2-4) Side-by-side boxplot of Years based on picture groups. 

```{r Figure2-4, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-4)",echo=F,cache=T}
old.par<- par(mai=c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5))
boxplot(Years~Attr,data=MockJury)
```

```{r eval=F}
boxplot(Years~Attr, data=MockJury)
```

\indent The "~" (which is read as the *tilde* symbol, which you can find in the
upper left corner of your keyboard) notation will be used in two ways this 
semester. The formula use in R employed previously declares that the 
response variable here is *Years* and the explanatory variable is *Attr*. 
The other use for "~" is as shorthand for "is distributed as" and is used in
the context of $Y\sim N(0,1)$, which translates (in statistics) to defining the 
random variable *Y* as following a Normal distribution^[Remember the 
bell-shaped curve you encountered in introductory statistics? If not, you can 
see some at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution] with mean 0 
and standard deviation of 1. In the current situation, we could ask whether
the ``Years`` variable seems like it may follow a normal distribution, in 
other words, is $\text{Years}\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$? Since the responses are right
skewed with some groups having outliers, it is not reasonable to assume that
the *Years* variable for any of the three groups may follow a Normal 
distribution (more later on the issues this creates!). Remember that 
$\mu$ and $\sigma$ are parameters where 
$\mu$ ("mu") is our standard symbol for the ***population mean***
and that $\sigma$ ("sigma") is the symbol of the 
***population standard deviation***. 

##Beanplots {#section2-2}

The other graphical display for comparing multiple groups we will use is a display called a ***beanplot*** [@Kampstra2008]. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-5) 
shows an example of a beanplot that provides a side-by-side display that 
contains the density curves, the original observations that generated the 
density curve in a (jittered) rug-plot, the mean of each group, and the 
overall mean of the entire data set. For each group, the density curves 
are mirrored to aid in visual assessment of the shape of the distribution, 
which makes a "bean" of sorts. This mirroring also
creates a shape that resembles a violin with skewed distributions so this
display has also been called a "violin plot". The beanplot includes bold
horizontal lines at the mean for each group and adds a lighter
dashed line for the overall mean to allow comparison of that global mean with the individual group means. All together this plot shows us information
on the center (mean), spread, and shape of the distributions of the responses. 
Our inferences typically focus on the means of the groups and this plot allows
us to compare those across the groups while gaining information on the shapes
of the distributions of responses in each group. 

\indent To use the ``beanplot`` function we need to install and then load the ``beanplot`` 
package [@R-beanplot]. The function works like the boxplot used previously
except that options 
for ``log``, ``col``, and ``method`` need to be specified. Use these^[Well, you 
can use other colors (try "lightblue" for example), but I think bisque
looks nice in these plots.] options for any beanplots you make: 
``log="", col="bisque", method="jitter"``. 

(ref:fig2-5) Beanplot of Years by picture group. Long, bold lines correspond 
to mean of each group, dashed line for overall or global mean.

```{r Figure2-5, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-5)",echo=F,cache=T}
require(beanplot)
old.par <- par(mai=c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5))
beanplot(Years~Attr,data=MockJury,log="",col="bisque",method="jitter")
```

```{r eval=F}
require(beanplot)
beanplot(Years~Attr, data=MockJury, log="", col="bisque", method="jitter")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-5) reinforces the strong right skews that were also 
detected in the boxplots previously. The three large sentences of 15 years 
can now be clearly identified, with one in the *Beautiful* group and two in 
the *Unattractive* group. The *Unattractive* group seems to have more high
observations than the other groups even though the *Beautiful* group had the 
largest number of observations around 10 years. The mean sentence was highest 
for the *Unattractive* group and the difference in the means between 
*Beautiful* and *Average* was small. 

\indent In this example, it appears that the mean for *Unattractive* is larger 
than the other two groups. But is this difference real? We will never 
know the answer to that question, but we 
can assess how likely we are to have seen a result as extreme or more 
extreme than our result, assuming that there is no difference in the 
means of the groups. And if the observed result is
(extremely) unlikely to occur, then we can reject the hypothesis that the
groups have the same mean and conclude that there is evidence of a real
difference. To start exploring whether there are differences in the means, we
need to have numerical values to compare. We can get means and standard
deviations by groups easily using the same formula notation with the ``mean``
and ``sd`` functions if the ``mosaic`` package is loaded.

\newpage

```{r}
require(mosaic)
mean(Years~Attr, data=MockJury)
sd(Years~Attr, data=MockJury)
```

We can also use the ``favstats`` function to get those summaries and others by groups.

```{r}
favstats(Years~Attr, data=MockJury)
```

\indent Based on these results, we can see that there is an estimated difference of 
almost 2 years in the mean sentence between *Average* and *Unattractive* groups. Because there are three groups being compared in this study, we will have to 
wait until Chapter 3 and the One-Way ANOVA test to fully assess evidence 
related to some difference among the three groups. For now, we are going to 
focus on comparing the mean *Years* between *Average* and *Unattractive* groups
-- which is a ***2 independent sample mean*** situation and something you 
should have seen before. Remember that the "independent" sample part of 
this refers to observations that are independently observed for the two 
groups as opposed to the paired sample situation that you may have 
explored where one observation from the first group is related to an 
observation in the second group (two measures on the same person (we 
generically call this "repeated measures")
or the famous "twin" studies with one twin assigned to each group). 

\indent Here we are going to use the "simple" two independent group scenario to 
review some basic statistical concepts and connect two different 
frameworks for conducting statistical inference: randomization and 
parametric inference techniques. ***Parametric*** statistical methods 
involve making assumptions about the distribution of the
responses and obtaining confidence intervals and/or p-values using a 
*named* distribution (like the $z$ or $t$-distributions). Typically these
results are generated using formulas and looking up areas under curves or
cutoffs using a table or a computer. ***Randomization***-based statistical
methods use a computer to shuffle, sample, or simulate observations in ways
that allow you to obtain distributions of possible results to find areas and
cutoffs without resorting to using tables and named distributions. 
Randomization methods are what are called ***nonparametric*** methods 
that often make fewer assumptions (they are ***not free of assumptions***!)
and so can handle a larger set of problems more easily than parametric 
methods. When the assumptions involved in the parametric procedures are 
met by a data set, the randomization methods often provide very similar 
results to those provided by the parametric techniques. To be a more 
sophisticated statistical consumer, it is useful to have some knowledge 
of both of these techniques for performing statistical inference and the fact that 
they can provide similar results might deepen your understanding of both 
approaches. 

\indent We will start with comparing the *Average* and *Unattractive* groups to 
compare these two ways of doing inference. We could remove the *Beautiful* 
group observations in a spreadsheet program and read that new data set 
back into R, but it is actually pretty easy to use R to do data
management once the data set is loaded. To remove the observations that came
from the *Beautiful* group, we are going to generate a new variable 
that we will call ``NotBeautiful`` that is true when observations came
from another group (*Average* or *Unattractive*) and false for observations
from the *Beautiful* group. To do this, we will apply the ***not equal***
logical function (``!=`` ) to the variable ``Attr``, inquiring whether it 
was different from the ``"Beautiful"`` level. You can see the content of the 
new variable in the output:

```{r}
MockJury$NotBeautiful <- MockJury$Attr != "Beautiful"
MockJury$NotBeautiful
```

This new variable is only FALSE for the *Beautiful* responses as we can see
if we compare some of the results from the original and new variable:

```{r}
head(tibble(MockJury$Attr, MockJury$NotBeautiful))
```

```{r}
tail(tibble(MockJury$Attr, MockJury$NotBeautiful))
```

To get rid of one of the responses that are in one of the groups, we need to learn a little bit about data 
management in R. ***Brackets*** ``([,])`` are used to access and possibly modify the rows or
columns in a tibble with entries before the comma operating on rows and
entries after the comma on the columns. For example, if you want to see the
results for the 5^th^ subject, you can reference the 5^th^ row of the 
tibble using ``[5,]`` after the tibble name:

```{r}
MockJury[5,]
```

We could just extract the *Years* response for the 5^th^ 
subject by incorporating information on the row and column of interest 
(``Years`` is the 3^rd^ column):

```{r}
MockJury[5,3]
```

In R, we can use logical vectors to keep any rows of the tibble where 
the variable is true and drop any rows where it is false by placing the 
logical variable in the first element of the brackets. The reduced version 
of the data set should be saved with a different name such as ``MockJury2`` 
that is used here to reduce the chances of confusing it with the previous 
full data set:

```{r}
MockJury2 <- MockJury[MockJury$NotBeautiful,]
```

You will always want to check that the correct observations were dropped 
either using ``View(MockJury2)`` or by doing a quick summary of the 
``Attr`` variable in the new tibble. 

```{r}
summary(MockJury2$Attr)
```

It ends up that R remembers the *Beautiful* category even though there are
0 observations in it now and that can cause us some problems. When we remove a
group of observations^[It is also possible to use the ``subset`` function to eliminate observations that do not have a particular trait and ``subset(MockJury,subset=NotBeautiful)`` would provide the same result as ``MockJury[MockJury$NotBeautiful,]`` did here.], we sometimes need to clean up categorical variables to
just reflect the categories that are present. The ``factor`` function 
creates categorical variables based on the levels of the variables that are 
observed and is useful to run here to clean up ``Attr``. 

```{r}
MockJury2$Attr <- factor(MockJury2$Attr) 
summary(MockJury2$Attr)
```

Now if we remake the boxplots and beanplots, they only contain results for 
the two groups of interest here as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-6). 

(ref:fig2-6) Boxplot and beanplot of the *Years* responses on the reduced ``MockJury2`` data set.

```

```{r eval=F}

beanplot(Years~Attr, data=MockJury2, log="", col="bisque", method="jitter")
```

\indent The two-sample mean techniques you learned in your previous course all 
start with comparing the means the two groups. We can obtain the two 
means using the ``mean`` function or directly obtain the difference 
in the means using the ``diffmean`` function (both require the ``mosaic``
package). The ``diffmean`` function provides 
$\bar{x}_\text{Unattractive} - \bar{x}_\text{Average}$ where $\bar{x}$
(read as "x-bar") is the sample mean of observations in the subscripted 
group. Note that there are two directions that you could compare the
means and this function chooses to take the mean from the second group 
name *alphabetically* and subtract the mean from the first alphabetical group 
name. It is always good to check the direction of this calculation as 
having a difference of $-1.84$ years versus $1.84$ years could be important. 

```{r}
mean(Years~Attr, data=MockJury2)
```

```{r}
diffmean(Years~Attr, data=MockJury2)
```

## Models, hypotheses, and permutations for the two sample mean situation {#section2-3}

There appears to be some evidence that the *Unattractive* group is 
getting higher average lengths of sentences from the prisoner "jurors" than
the *Average* group, but we want to make sure that the difference is 
real -- that there is evidence to reject the assumption that the means 
are the same "in the population". First, a ***null hypothesis***^[The 
hypothesis of no difference that is typically generated in the hopes of
being rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, which contains the sort
of difference that is of interest in the application.] which 
defines a ***null model***^[The null model is the statistical model that 
is implied by the chosen null hypothesis. Here, a null hypothesis of no 
difference translates to having a model with the same mean for both groups.] 
needs to be determined in terms of ***parameters*** (the true values in 
the population). The research question should help you determine the form of the
hypotheses for the assumed population. In the 2 independent sample mean
problem, the interest is in testing a null hypothesis of $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$
versus the alternative hypothesis of $H_A: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$, where 
$\mu_1$ is the parameter for the true mean of the first group and $\mu_2$
is the parameter for the true mean of the second group. The alternative
hypothesis involves assuming a statistical model for the $i^{th}\ (i=1,\ldots,n_j)$
response from the $j^{th}\ (j=1,2)$ group, $\boldsymbol{y}_{ij}$, that 
involves modeling it as $y_{ij} = \mu_j + \varepsilon_{ij}$, 
where we assume that $\varepsilon_{ij} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. For the moment, 
focus on the models that either assume the means are the same (null) or 
different (alternative), which imply:

* Null Model: $y_{ij} = \mu + \varepsilon_{ij}$ There is **no**
difference in **true** means for the two groups.

* Alternative Model: $y_{ij} = \mu_j + \varepsilon_{ij}$ There is **a**
difference in **true** means for the two groups.


Suppose we are considering the alternative model for the 4^th^
observation ($i=4$) from the second group ($j=2$), then the model for 
this observation is $y_{42} = \mu_2 +\varepsilon_{42}$, that defines the 
response as coming from the true mean for the second group plus a 
random error term for that observation, $\varepsilon_{42}$. For, say, the 
5^th^ observation from the first group ($j=1$), the model is 
$y_{51} = \mu_1 +\varepsilon_{51}$. If we were working with the null model, 
the mean is always the same ($\mu$) -- the group specified does not change 
the mean we use for that observation. 

\indent It can be helpful to think about the null and alternative models graphically.
By assuming the null hypothesis is true (means are equal) and that the random
errors around the mean follow a normal distribution, we assume that the truth
is as displayed in the left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-7) -- two 
normal distributions with the same mean and variability. The alternative 
model allows the two groups to potentially have different means, such as 
those displayed in the right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-7) where the 
second group has a larger mean. Note that in this scenario, we assume that 
the observations all came from the same distribution except that they had 
different means. Depending on the statistical procedure we are using, we 
basically are going to assume that the observations ($y_{ij}$) either were 
generated as samples from the null or alternative model. You can imagine 
drawing observations at random from the pictured distributions. For hypothesis 
testing, the null model is assumed to be true and then the unusualness of 
the actual result is assessed relative to that assumption. In hypothesis 
testing, we have to decide if we have enough evidence to reject the assumption 
that the null model (or hypothesis) is true. If we reject the null hypothesis, 
then we would conclude that the other model considered (the alternative 
model) is more reasonable. The researchers obviously would have hoped to 
encounter some sort of noticeable difference in the sentences provided for the
different pictures and have been able to find enough evidence to reject the null 
model where the groups "look the same". 

(ref:fig2-7) Illustration of the assumed situations under the null (left) 
and a single possibility that could occur if the alternative were true 
(right) and the true means were different. There are an infinite number of ways to make a plot like the right panel that satisfies the alternative hypothesis.

```


\indent In statistical inference, null hypotheses (and their implied models) are set 
up as "straw men" with every interest in rejecting them even though we assume 
they are true to be able to assess the evidence $\underline{\text{against them}}$.
Consider the original study design here, the pictures were randomly assigned to 
the subjects. If the null hypothesis were true, then we would have no difference 
in the population means of the groups. And this would apply if we had done a 
different random assignment of the pictures to the subjects. So let's try this: 
assume that the null hypothesis is true and randomly re-assign the treatments
(pictures) to the observations that were obtained. In other words, keep the 
sentences (*Years*) the same and shuffle the group labels randomly. The
technical term for this is doing a ***permutation*** (a random shuffling of 
a grouping variable relative to the observed responses). If the null is true 
and the means 
in the two groups are the same, then we should be able to re-shuffle the 
groups to the observed sentences (*Years*) and get results similar to those we
actually observed. If the null is false and the means are really different in
the two groups, then what we observed should differ from what we get under
other random permutations. The differences between the two groups should be
more noticeable in the observed data set than in (most) of the shuffled data
sets. It helps to see an example of a permutation of the labels to understand
what this means here. 

\indent In the ``mosaic`` package, the ``shuffle`` function allows us to easily perform
a permutation^[We'll see the ``shuffle`` function in a more common usage below; 
while the code to generate ``Perm1`` is provided, it isn't something to worry 
about right now.]. Just one time, we can explore what a permutation of the 
treatment labels could look like in the ``PermutedAttr`` variable below. Note 
that the ``Years`` are held in the same place while the group labels are shuffled. 

```{r echo=F}
set.seed(1234)
```

```{r}
Perm1 <- with(MockJury2, tibble(Years, Attr, PermutedAttr=shuffle(Attr)))
Perm1
```

If you count up the number of subjects in each group by counting the number 
of times each label (Average, Unattractive) occurs, it is the same in both the 
``Attr`` and ``PermutedAttr`` columns. Permutations involve randomly 
re-ordering the values of a variable -- here the ``Attr`` group labels -- without
changing the content of the variable. This result can also be generated using 
what is called ***sampling without replacement***: sequentially select $n$ labels 
from the original variable (*Attr*), removing each observed label and making sure that each of the
original ``Attr`` labels is selected once and only once. The new, randomly 
selected order of selected labels provides the permuted labels. Stepping
through the process helps to understand how it works: after the initial random
sample of one label, there would $n - 1$ choices possible; on the $n^{th}$
selection, there would only be one label remaining to select. This makes sure
that all original labels are re-used but that the order is random. Sampling
without replacement is like picking names out of a hat, one-at-a-time, and not
putting the names back in after they are selected. It is an exhaustive process
for all the original observations. ***Sampling with replacement***, in contrast,
involves sampling from the specified list with each observation having an equal 
chance of selection for each sampled observation -- in other words, observations 
can be selected more than once. This is like picking $n$ names out of a hat that
contains $n$ names, except that every time a name is selected, it goes back into 
the hat -- we'll use this technique in Section \@ref(section2-8)
to do what is called ***bootstrapping***. Both sampling mechanisms can be 
used to generate inferences but each has particular situations
where they are most useful. For hypothesis testing, we will use permutations
(sampling without replacement) as its mechanism most closely matches the null hypotheses we will be testing. 

\indent The comparison of the beanplots for the real data set and permuted version of 
the labels is what is really interesting (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-8)). The 
original difference in the sample means of the two groups was 1.84 years 
(*Unattractive* minus *Average*). The sample means are the ***statistics*** 
that estimate the parameters for the true means of the two groups. In the 
permuted data set, the difference in the means is 1.15 years in the opposite 
direction (Average had a higher mean than Unattractive in the permuted data). 

```{r}
mean(Years~PermutedAttr, data=Perm1)
```

```{r}
diffmean(Years~PermutedAttr, data=Perm1)
```

(ref:fig2-8) Boxplots of Years responses versus actual treatment groups and 
permuted groups. Note how the responses are the same but that they are shuffled between the two groups differently in the permuted data set.


```{r Figure2-8, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-8)",echo=F, fig.width=7}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
old.par <- par(mai=c(0.5,0.5,0.75,0.5))
beanplot(Years~Attr,data=Perm1,log="",col="bisque",method="jitter",
         main="Original data")
beanplot(Years~PermutedAttr,data=Perm1,log="",col="bisque",method="jitter",
         main="Permuted group labels")
```

These results suggest that the observed difference was larger than what we got 
when we did a single permutation although it was only a little bit larger than 
a difference we could observe in permutations if we ignore the difference in 
directions. Conceptually, permuting observations between group labels is 
consistent with the null hypothesis -- this is a technique to generate results 
that we might have gotten if the null hypothesis were true since the responses 
are the same in the two groups if the null is true. We just need to repeat the
permutation process many times and track how unusual our observed result is 
relative to this distribution of potential responses if the null were true. 
If the observed differences are unusual relative to the results under 
permutations, then there is evidence against the null hypothesis, the null 
hypothesis should be rejected (Reject $H_0$), and a conclusion should be made, 
in the direction of the alternative hypothesis, that there is evidence that the 
true means differ. If the observed differences are similar to (or at least not 
unusual relative to) what we get under random shuffling under the null model, 
we would have a tough time concluding that there is any real difference between 
the groups based on our observed data set. 

## Permutation testing for the two sample mean situation {#section2-4}

In any testing situation, you must define some function of the observations that
gives us a single number that addresses our question of interest. This quantity
is called a ***test statistic***. These often take on complicated forms and 
have names like $t$ or $z$ statistics that relate to their parametric (named)
distributions so we know where to look up ***p-values***^[P-values are the 
probability of obtaining a result as extreme as or more extreme than we observed 
given that the null hypothesis is true.]. In randomization settings, they can
have simpler forms because we use the data set to find the distribution of the statistic and don't need to rely on a named distribution. We will label our test statistic ***T*** (for **T**est statistic) unless the test statistic has a commonly
used name. Since we are interested in comparing the means of the two groups, we
can define

$$T=\bar{x}_\text{Unattractive}-\bar{x}_\text{Average},$$

which coincidentally is what the ``diffmean`` function provided us previously. 
We label our ***observed test statistic*** (the one from the original data 
set) as

$$T_{obs}=\bar{x}_\text{Unattractive}-\bar{x}_\text{Average},$$

which happened to be 1.84 years here. We will compare this result to the results 
for the test statistic that we obtain from permuting the group labels. To 
denote permuted results, we will add a * to the labels:

$$T^*=\bar{x}_{\text{Unattractive}^*}-\bar{x}_{\text{Average}^*}.$$

We then compare the $T_{obs}=\bar{x}_\text{Unattractive}-\bar{x}_\text{Average} = 1.84$
to the distribution of results that are possible for the permuted results ($T^*$)
which corresponds to assuming the null hypothesis is true. 

\indent We need to consider lots of permutations to do a permutation test. In contrast to
your introductory statistics course where, if you did this, it was just a click
away, we are going to learn what was going on under the hood. Specifically, we
need a ***for loop*** in R to be able to repeatedly generate the permuted data
sets and record $T^*$ for each one. Loops are a basic programming task that make
randomization methods possible as well as potentially simplifying any repetitive
computing task. To write a "for loop", we need to choose how many times we want 
to do the loop (call that ``B``) and decide on a counter to keep track of where 
we are at in the loops (call that ``b``, which goes from 1 up to ``B``). The 
simplest loop just involves printing out the index, ``print(b)`` at each step. 
This is our first use of curly braces, { and}, that are used to group the code 
we want to repeatedly run as we proceed through the loop. By typing the following 
code in the script window and then highlighting it all and hitting the run button, 
R will go through the loop 5 times, printing out the counter:

```
B <- 5
for (b in (1:B)){
  print(b)
}
```

Note that when you highlight and run the code, it will look about the same with 
"+" printed after the first line to indicate that all the code is connected when 
it appears in the console, looking like this:

```r
> for(b in (1:B)){
+   print(b)
+ }
```

When you run these three lines of code, the console will show you the following 
output:

```r
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
```

\indent Instead of printing the counter, we want to use the loop to repeatedly compute 
our test statistic across B random permutations of the observations. The 
``shuffle`` function performs permutations of the group labels relative to 
responses and the ``diffmean`` difference in the two group means in the permuted 
data set. For a single permutation, the combination of shuffling ``Attr`` and 
finding the difference in the means, storing it in a variable called ``Ts`` is:

```{r}
Ts <- diffmean(Years~shuffle(Attr), data=MockJury2)
Ts
```

And putting this inside the ``print`` function allows us to find the test 
statistic under 5 different permutations easily:

```{r}
B <- 5
for (b in (1:B)){
  Ts <- diffmean(Years~shuffle(Attr), data=MockJury2)
  print(Ts)
}
```

Finally, we would like to store the values of the test statistic instead of 
just printing them out on each pass through the loop. To do this, we need to 
create a variable to store the results, let's call it ``Tstar``. We know that 
we need to store ``B`` results so will create a vector^[In statistics, vectors are one dimensional lists of numeric elements -- basically a column from a matrix or our tibble.] of length B, which 
contains B elements, full of missing values (NA) using the ``matrix`` function with the ``nrow`` option specifying the number of elements:

```{r}
Tstar <- matrix(NA, nrow=B)
Tstar
```

Now we can run our loop B times and store the results in ``Tstar``. 

```{r}
for (b in (1:B)){
  Tstar[b] <- diffmean(Years ~ shuffle(Attr), data=MockJury2)
}
Tstar
```

\indent Five permutations are still not enough to assess whether our $T_{obs}$
of 1.84 is unusual and we need to do many permutations to get an accurate 
assessment of the possibilities under the null hypothesis. It is common practice 
to consider something like 1,000 permutations. The ``Tstar`` vector when we set 
*B* to be large, say ``B=1000``, contains the permutation distribution for the
selected test statistic under^[We often say
"under" in statistics and we mean "given that the following is true".] the null
hypothesis -- what is called the ***null distribution*** of the statistic. The 
null distribution is the distribution of possible values of a statistic
under the null hypothesis. We want to visualize this distribution and use it to
assess how unusual our $T_{obs}$ result of 1.84 years was relative to all the
possibilities under permutations (under the null hypothesis). So we repeat the
loop, now with $B=1000$ and generate a histogram, density curve, and summary
statistics of the results:

(ref:fig2-9) Histogram (left, with counts in bars) and density curve (right) of 
values of test statistic for 1,000 permutations. 

```{r Figure2-9, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-9)",echo=F,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,cache=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
B <- 1000
Tstar <- matrix(NA, nrow=B)
for (b in (1:B)){
  Tstar[b] <- diffmean(Years ~ shuffle(Attr), data=MockJury2)
}
hist(Tstar, label=T,ylim=c(0,250))
plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar")
```

```{r eval=F}
B <- 1000
Tstar <- matrix(NA, nrow=B)
for (b in (1:B)){
  Tstar[b] <- diffmean(Years~shuffle(Attr), data=MockJury2)
}
hist(Tstar, label=T)
plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar")
```

```{r}
favstats(Tstar)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-9) contains visualizations of $T^*$ and the ``favstats``
summary provides the related numerical summaries. Our observed $T_{obs}$
of 1.84 seems fairly unusual relative to these results with only 
`r pdata(Tstar,2,lower.tail=F)*1000` $T^*$ values over 2 based on the 
histogram. We need to make more specific comparisons of the permuted results 
versus our observed result to be able to clearly decide whether our observed 
result is really unusual. 

\indent To make the comparisons more concrete, first we can enhance the previous graphs 
by adding the value of the test statistic from the real data set, as shown in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-10), using the ``abline`` function to draw a vertical 
line at our $T_{obs}$ value specified in the ``v`` (for vertical) option. 

(ref:fig2-10) Histogram (left) and density curve (right) of
values of test statistic for 1,000 permutations with bold vertical line for
value of observed test statistic. 

```{r Figure2-10, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-10)",echo=F,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,cache=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
Tobs <- 1.837
hist(Tstar, labels=T,ylim=c(0,250))
abline(v=Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
plot(density(Tstar),main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
```

```{r eval=F}
Tobs <- 1.837
hist(Tstar, labels=T)
abline(v=Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
```

Second, we can calculate the exact number of permuted results that were as 
large or larger 
than what we observed. To calculate the proportion of the 1,000 values that were 
as large or larger than what we observed, we will use the ``pdata`` function. 
To use this 
function, we need to provide the distribution of values to compare to the cut-off
(``Tstar``), the cut-off point (``Tobs``), and whether we want calculate the
proportion that are below (left of) or above (right of) the cut-off 
(``lower.tail=F`` option provides the proportion of values above the cutoff 
of interest). 


```{r}
pdata(Tstar, Tobs, lower.tail=F)
```

```{r echo=F}
pval <- pdata(Tstar, Tobs, lower.tail=F)
```

The proportion of `r pval` tells us that `r pval*1000` of the 1,000 permuted results 
(`r pval*100`%) were as large or larger than what we observed. This type of 
work is how we can
generate ***p-values*** using permutation distributions. P-values, as you should
remember, are the probability of getting a result as extreme as or more extreme 
than what we observed, $\underline{\text{given that the null is true}}$. Finding 
only `r pval*1000`
permutations of 1,000 that were larger than our observed result suggests that it 
is hard to find a result like what we observed if there really were no difference,
although it is not impossible. 

\indent When testing hypotheses for two groups, there are two types of alternative
hypotheses, one-sided or two-sided. ***One-sided tests*** involve only considering
differences in one-direction (like $\mu_1 > \mu_2$) and are performed when 
researchers can decide ***a priori***^[This is a fancy way of saying "in advance",
here in advance of seeing the observations.] which group should have a larger mean 
if there is going to be any sort of difference. In this situation, we did not 
know enough about the potential impacts of the pictures to know which group should 
be larger than the other so should do a two-sided test. It is important to 
remember that you can't look at the responses to decide on the hypotheses. It is
often safer and more ***conservative***^[Statistically, a conservative method is 
one that provides less chance of rejecting the null hypothesis in comparison to 
some other method or less than some pre-defined standard.] to start with a
***two-sided alternative*** ($\mathbf{H_A: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2}$). To do a 2-sided 
test, find the area larger than what we observed as above. We also need to add 
the area in the other tail (here the left tail) similar to what we observed in the
right tail. Some people suggest doubling the area in one tail but we will collect
information on the number that were more as or more extreme than the same 
value in the other 
tail. In other words, we count the proportion over 1.84 and below -1.84. So 
we need to also find how many of the permuted results were smaller than or equal 
to -1.84 years 
to add to our previous proportion. Using ``pdata`` with ``-Tobs`` as the cut-off 
and ``lower.tail=T`` provides this result:

```{r}
pdata(Tstar, -Tobs, lower.tail=T)
```

```{r echo=F}
pval_2 <- pdata(Tstar, -Tobs, lower.tail=T)
```

So the p-value to test our null hypothesis of no difference in the true means 
between the groups is `r pval` + `r pval_2`, providing a p-value of `r pval+pval_2`.
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-11) shows both cut-offs on the histogram and density curve. 

(ref:fig2-11) Histogram and density curve of values of test statistic for 1,000
permutations with bold lines for value of observed test statistic (1.84) and its
opposite value (-1.84) required for performing the two-sided test.

```{r Figure2-11, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-11)",echo=F,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,cache=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

abline(v=c(-1,1)*Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
plot(density(Tstar),main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=c(-1,1)*Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
```

```{r eval=F}

plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=c(-1,1)*Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
```

\indent In general, the ***one-sided test p-value*** is the proportion of the 
permuted results that are as extreme or more extreme than observed in the 
direction of the *alternative*
hypothesis (lower or upper tail, remembering that this also depends on the 
direction of the difference taken). For the 2-sided test, the p-value is the
proportion of the permuted results that are *less than or equal to the negative
version of the observed statistic and greater than or equal to the positive 
version of the observed statistic*. Using absolute 
values (| |), we can simplify this: the ***two-sided p-value*** is the 
*proportion of the |permuted statistics| that are as large or larger than 
|observed statistic|*.
This will always work and finds areas in both tails regardless of whether the 
observed statistic is positive or negative. In R, the ``abs`` function provides the
***absolute value*** and we can again use ``pdata`` to find our p-value in one line 
of code: 

```{r}
pdata(abs(Tstar), abs(Tobs), lower.tail=F)
```

We will encourage you to think through what might constitute strong evidence 
against your null hypotheses and then discuss how strong you feel the evidence 
is against the null hypothesis in the p-value that you obtained. Basically, 
p-values present a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis, with smaller
values presenting more evidence against the null. They range from 0 to 1 and you
should interpret them on a graded scale from strong evidence (close to 0) to no
evidence (close 1). We will discuss the use of a fixed ***significance level*** 
below as it is still commonly used in many fields and is necessary to think 
about the theory of hypothesis testing, but, for the moment,
we can conclude that there is moderate evidence against the null hypothesis 
presented by having a p-value of 0.034 because our observed result is somewhat 
rare relative to what we would expect if the null hypothesis was true. And so 
we would likely ***reject the null hypothesis*** and conclude (in the direction 
of the alternative) that there is a difference in the population means in the 
two groups.  
 

\indent Before we move on, let's note some interesting features of the permutation 
distribution of the difference in the sample means shown in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-11). 

1. It is basically centered at 0. Since we are performing permutations assuming 
the null model is true, we are assuming that $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ which implies that
$\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$. This also suggests that 0 should be the center of the 
permutation distribution and it was. 

2. It is approximately normally distributed. This is due to the ***Central Limit Theorem***^[We'll leave the discussion of the CLT to your previous statistics coursework 
or an internet search. For this material, just remember that it has something to do with distributions
looking more normal as the sample size increases.], where the 
***sampling distribution*** (distribution of all possible results for samples 
of this size) of the difference in sample means ($\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$) becomes 
more normally distributed as the sample sizes increase. With 38 and 37 
observations in the groups, we are likely to have a relatively normal looking
distribution of the difference in the sample means. This result will allow us to 
use a parametric method to approximate this sampling distribution under the null 
model if some assumptions are met, as we'll discuss below. 

3. Our observed difference in the sample means (1.84 years) is a fairly unusual 
result relative to the rest of these results but there are some permuted data 
sets that produce more extreme differences in the sample means. When the 
observed differences are really large, we may not see any permuted results 
that are as extreme as what we observed. When ``pdata`` gives you 0, the p-value
should be reported to be smaller than 0.0001 (**not 0!**) since it happened 
in less than 1 in 1,000 tries but does occur once -- in the actual data set. 

4. Since our null model is not specific about the direction of the difference, 
considering a result like ours but in the other direction (-1.84 years) needs to 
be included. The observed result seems to put about the same area in both tails 
of the distribution but it is not exactly the same. The small difference in the 
tails is a useful aspect of this approach compared to the parametric method 
discussed below as it accounts for potential asymmetry in the sampling distribution. 

\indent Earlier, we decided that the p-value provided moderate evidence against
the null hypothesis and that we should reject the null. In this 
course, you will often be allowed to use your own judgment about an appropriate
significance level in a particular situation (in other words, if we forget to 
tell you an $\alpha$ -level, you can still make a decision based on how strong 
you feel the evidence was against the null based on the p-value). Remembering 
that the p-value is the probability 
you would observe a result like you did (or more extreme), assuming the null 
hypothesis is true; this tells you that the smaller the p-value is, the more 
evidence you have against the null. Figure \@ref(fig:FigurePValStr) provides a 
diagram of some suggestions for the graded p-value interpretation that you can 
use. The next section provides a more formal 
review of the hypothesis testing infrastructure, terminology, and some of 
things that can happen when testing hypotheses. P-values have been (validly)
criticized for the inability of studies to be reproduced, for the bias in 
publications to only include studies that have small p-values, and for the lack of
thought that often accompanies using a fixed significance level. To alleviate 
some of these criticisms, we recommend reporting the strength of evidence of the
result based on the p-value and also reporting and discussing the size of the
estimated results (with a measure of precision of the estimated difference).

evidence based on gradient of p-values.

## Hypothesis testing (general) {#section2-5}

In hypothesis testing (sometimes more explicitly called "Null Hypothesis 
Significance Testing" or NHST), it is formulated to answer a specific question about
a population or true parameter(s) using a statistic based on a data set.
In your previous statistics course, you (hopefully) considered one-sample 
hypotheses about population means and proportions and the two sample mean 
situation we are focused on here. Our hypotheses relate to trying to answer 
the question about whether the population mean sentences between the two 
groups are different, with an initial assumption of no difference. 

\indent NHST is much like a criminal trial with a jury where you are in the role
of a jury member. Initially, the defendant
is assumed innocent. In our situation, the true means are assumed to be 
equal between the groups. Then evidence is presented and, as a juror,
you analyze it. In statistical hypothesis testing, data are collected and 
analyzed. Then you have to decide if we had "enough" evidence to reject 
the initial assumption ("innocence" that is initially assumed). To make 
this decision, you want to have thought about and decided on the standard of 
evidence required to reject the initial assumption. In criminal cases, 
"beyond a reasonable doubt" is used. Wikipedia's definition
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt) suggests that this 
standard is that "there can still be a doubt, but only to the extent 
that it would not affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether 
or not the defendant is guilty". In civil trials, a lower standard called 
a "preponderance of evidence" is used. Based on that defined and pre-decided
(*a priori*) measure, you decide that the defendant is guilty or not guilty.
In statistics, we can compare our p-value to a significance level, $\alpha$, 
which is most of the time selected to be 5%. If our p-value is less than 
$\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis. The choice of the significance level 
is like the variation in standards of evidence between criminal and civil 
trials -- and in all situations everyone should know the standards required 
for rejecting the initial assumption before any information is "analyzed".
Once someone is found guilty, then there is the matter of sentencing which 
is related to the impacts ("size") of the crime. In statistics, this is 
similar to the estimated size of differences and the related judgments 
about whether the differences are practically important or not. If the 
crime is proven beyond a reasonable doubt but it is a minor crime, then 
the sentence will be small. With the same level of evidence and a more 
serious crime, the sentence will be more dramatic. 

\indent There are some important aspects of the testing process to note that inform 
how we interpret statistical hypothesis test results. When someone is found 
"not guilty", it does not mean "innocent", it just means that there was not 
enough evidence to find the person guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt".
Not finding enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis does not imply 
that the true means are equal, just that there was not enough evidence to 
conclude that they were different. There are many potential reasons why we 
might fail to reject the null, but the most common one is that our sample 
size was too small (which is related to having too little evidence). Other 
reasons include simply the variation in taking a random sample from the 
population(s). This randomness in samples and the differences in the sample 
means also implies that p-values are random and can easily vary if the data set
had been slightly different. This also relates to the suggestion of using a 
graded interpretation of p-values -- if the p-value is an estimated quantity, 
is there really any difference between p-values of 0.049 and 0.051? We 
probably shouldn't think there is a big difference in results for these two 
p-values even though the standard NHST reject/fail to reject the null approach
considers these as completely different results. So where does that leave us?
Interpret the p-values using strength of evidence against the null hypothesis,
remembering that smaller (but not really small) p-values can still be 
interesting. And if you think the p-value is small enough, then you can reject 
the null hypothesis.

\indent Throughout this material, we will continue to re-iterate the distinctions 
between parameters and statistics and want you to be clear about the 
distinctions between estimates based on the sample and inferences for the
population or true values of the parameters of interest. Remember that 
statistics are summaries of the sample information and parameters are 
characteristics of populations (which we rarely know). In the two-sample 
mean situation, the sample means are always at least a little different 
-- that is not an interesting conclusion. What is interesting is whether
we have enough evidence to feel like we have proven that the population or true means
differ "beyond a reasonable doubt". 

\indent The scope of any inferences is constrained based on whether there is a 
***random sample*** (RS) and/or ***random assignment*** (RA).
Table \@ref(tab:Table2-2) contains the four possible combinations of these 
two characteristics of a given study. Random assignment of treatment levels to
subjects allows for causal
inferences for differences that are observed -- the difference in treatment
levels is said to cause differences in the mean responses. Random sampling (or 
at least some sort of representative sample) allows inferences to be made to 
the population of interest. If we do not have RA, then causal inferences cannot 
be made. If we do not have a representative sample, then our inferences are
limited to the sampled subjects.

\normalsize

\indent A simple example helps to clarify how the scope of inference can change 
based on the study design. Suppose
we are interested in studying the GPA of students. If we had taken a random 
sample from, say, the STAT 217 students in a given semester, our scope of 
inference would be the population of STAT 217 students in that semester. If we had 
taken a random sample from the entire MSU population, then the inferences would 
be to the entire MSU population in that semester. These are similar types of 
problems but the two populations are very different and the group you are trying 
to make conclusions about should be noted carefully in your results -- it does 
matter! If we did not have a representative sample, say the students could 
choose to provide this information or not, then we can only make inferences to
volunteers. These volunteers might differ in systematic ways from the entire
population of STAT 217 students so we cannot safely extend our inferences beyond 
the group that volunteered. 

\indent To consider the impacts of RA versus results from purely observational
studies, we need to be 
comparing groups. Suppose that we are interested in differences in the mean 
GPAs for different sections of STAT 217 and that we take a random sample of 
students from each section and compare the results and find evidence of some
difference. In this scenario, we can conclude that there is some difference in
the population of STAT 217 students but we can't say that being in different 
sections caused the differences in the mean GPAs. Now suppose that we randomly
assigned every STAT 217 student to get extra training in one of three different 
study techniques and found evidence of differences among the training methods.
We could conclude that the training methods caused the differences in these 
students. These conclusions would only apply to STAT 217 students and could 
not be generalized to a larger population of students. If we took a random 
sample of STAT 217 students (say only 10 from each section) and then randomly 
assigned them to one of three training programs and found evidence of 
differences, then we can say that the training programs caused the differences.
But we can also say that we have evidence that those differences pertain to the 
population of STAT 217 students. This seems similar to the scenario where all
STAT 217 students participated in the training programs except that by using random
sampling, only a fraction of the population needs to actually be studied to 
make inferences to the entire population of interest -- saving time and money. 

\indent A quick summary of the terminology of hypothesis testing is useful at this 
point. The ***null hypothesis*** ($H_0$) states that there is no difference 
or no relationship in the population. This is the statement of no effect or 
no difference and the claim that we are trying to find evidence against. In 
this chapter, $H_0$: $\mu_1=\mu_2$. When doing two-group problems, you 
always need to specify which group is 1 and which one is 2 because the order 
does matter. The ***alternative hypothesis*** ($H_1$ or $H_A$) states a 
specific difference between parameters. This is the research hypothesis and 
the claim about the population that we hope to demonstrate is more reasonable 
to conclude than the null hypothesis. In the two-group situation, we can have
***one-sided alternatives*** $H_A: \mu_1 > \mu_2$ (greater than) or
$H_A: \mu_1 < \mu_2$ (less than) or, the more common, ***two-sided 
alternative*** $H_A: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ (not equal to). We usually default to 
using two-sided tests because we often do not know enough to know the 
direction of a difference in advance, especially in more complicated 
situations. The ***sampling distribution under the null*** is the 
distribution of all possible values of a statistic under the assumption that
$H_0$ is true. It 
is used to calculate the ***p-value***, the probability of obtaining a 
result as extreme or more extreme than what we observed given that the null 
hypothesis is true. We will find sampling distributions using 
***nonparametric*** approaches (like the permutation approach used previously) 
and ***parametric*** methods (using "named" distributions like the 
$t$, F, and $\chi^2$). 

\indent Small p-values are evidence against the null hypothesis because the observed
result is unlikely due to chance if $H_0$ is true. Large p-values provide
no evidence against $H_0$ but do not allow us to conclude that the null 
hypothesis is correct -- just that we didn't find enough evidence to think it 
was wrong. The ***level of significance*** is an *a priori* definition of
how small the p-value needs to be to provide "enough" (sufficient) evidence
against $H_0$. This is most useful to prevent sliding the standards after 
the results are found. We can compare the p-value to the level of significance to
decide if the p-value is small enough to constitute sufficient evidence to 
reject the null hypothesis. We use $\alpha$ to denote the level of 
significance and most typically use 0.05 which we refer to as the 5% 
significance level. We can compare the p-value to this level and make a 
decision, focusing our interpretation on the strength of evidence we found 
based on the p-value from very strong to none. 
If we are using the strict version of NHST, the two options for *decisions* are 
to either *reject the null hypothesis* 
if the p-value $\le \alpha$ or *fail to reject the null hypothesis* if the 
p-value $> \alpha$. When interpreting hypothesis testing results, remember 
that the p-value is a measure of how unlikely the observed outcome was, 
assuming that the null hypothesis is true. It is **NOT** the probability of 
the data or the probability of either hypothesis being true. The p-value, 
simply, is a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis. 

\indent Although we want to use graded evidence to interpret p-values, there 
is one situation where thinking about comparisons to fixed $\alpha$ levels is 
useful for understanding and studying statistical hypothesis testing. The 
specific definition of $\alpha$ is that it is the probability of rejecting
$H_0$ when $H_0$ is true, the probability of what is called a
***Type I error***. Type I errors are also called ***false rejections*** or 
***false detections***. In the two-group mean situation, a Type I error would 
be concluding that there 
is a difference in the true means between the groups when none really exists 
in the population. In the courtroom setting, this is like falsely finding 
someone guilty. We don't want to do this very often, so we use small values 
of the significance level, allowing us to control the rate of Type I errors 
at $\alpha$. We also have to worry about **Type II errors**, which are failing
to reject the null hypothesis when it's false. In a courtroom, this is the same
as failing to convict a truly guilty person. This most often occurs due to a 
lack of evidence that could be due to a small sample size or merely just an 
unusual sample from the population. You can use the Table \@ref(tab:Table2-3) 
to help you remember all the possibilities. 

(ref:tab2-3) Table of decisions and truth scenarios in a hypothesis 
testing situation. But we never know the truth in a real situation. 

```{r Table2-3, echo=F,results="asis"}

cell21 <- "**FTR** $\\mathbf{H_0}$"

             justify="left")
```

\indent In comparing different procedures or in planning studies, there is an 
interest in studying the rate or
probability of Type I and II errors. The probability of a Type I error was 
defined previously as $\alpha$, the significance level. The ***power*** of a
procedure is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.
Power is defined as

$$\text{Power} = 1 - \text{Probability(Type II error) } = 
\text{Probability(Reject) } H_0 | H_0 \text{ is false),}$$

or, in words, the probability of detecting a difference when it actually
exists. We want to use a statistical procedure that controls the Type I error 
rate at the pre-specified level and has high power to detect false null 
hypotheses. Increasing the sample size is one of the most commonly used 
methods for increasing the power in a given situation. Sometimes we can choose 
among different procedures and use the power of the procedures to help us make 
that selection. Note that there are many ways $H_0$ false and the power changes 
based on how false the null hypothesis actually is. To make this concrete, 
suppose that the true mean sentences differed by either 1 or 20 years in 
previous example. The chances of rejecting the null hypothesis are much larger 
when the groups actually differ by 20 years than if they differ by just 1 year, 
given the same sample size. For a given difference in the true means, the larger 
the sample, the higher the power of the study to actually find evidence of a
difference in the groups. 

\indent After making a decision (was there enough evidence to reject the null 
or not), we want to make the conclusions specific to the problem of interest. 
If we reject $H_0$, then we can conclude that there was sufficient evidence at 
the $\alpha$-level that the null hypothesis is wrong (and the results point in 
the direction of the alternative). If we fail to reject $H_0$ (FTR $H_0$), then 
we can conclude that there was insufficient evidence at the $\alpha$-level to say 
that the null hypothesis is wrong. We are **NOT** saying that the null is 
correct and we **NEVER** accept the null hypothesis. We just failed to find 
enough evidence to say it's wrong. If we find sufficient evidence to reject the 
null, then we need to revisit the method of data collection and design of the 
study to discuss scope of inference. Can we discuss causality (due to RA) and/or 
make inferences to a larger group than those in the sample (due to RS)?

## Connecting randomization (nonparametric) and parametric tests {#section2-6}

In developing statistical inference techniques, we need to define the test 
statistic, $T$, that measures the quantity of interest. To compare the means of 
two groups, a statistic is needed 
that measures their differences. In general, for comparing two groups, the
choices are simple -- a difference in the means often works well and is a
natural choice. There are other options such as tracking the ratio of means or
possibly the difference in medians. Instead of just using the difference in the
means, we also could "standardize" the difference in the means by dividing by
an appropriate quantity that reflects the variation in the difference in the
means. All of these are valid and can sometimes provide similar results - it
ends up that there are many possibilities for testing using the randomization
(nonparametric) techniques introduced previously. Parametric statistical
methods focus on means because the statistical theory surrounding means is
quite a bit easier (not easy, just easier) than other options but there are
just a couple of test statistics that you can use and end up with named
distributions to use for generating inferences. Randomization techniques allow
inference for other quantities but our focus here will be on using
randomization for inferences on means to see the similarities with the more
traditional parametric procedures. 

\indent In two-sample mean situations, instead of working just with the 
difference in the means, we often calculate a test statistic that is called the 
***equal variance two-independent samples t-statistic***. The test statistic is

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}},$$

where $s_1^2$ and $s_2^2$ are the sample variances for the two groups, $n_1$ and 
$n_2$ are the sample sizes for the two groups, and the 
***pooled sample standard deviation***, 

$$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}.$$

The $t$-statistic keeps the important comparison between the means in the
numerator that we used before and standardizes (re-scales) that difference so
that $t$ will follow a $t$-distribution (a parametric "named" distribution) if 
certain assumptions are met. But first we should see if standardizing the 
difference in the means had an impact on our permutation test results. Instead 
of using the ``diffmean`` function, we will use the ``t.test`` function (see 
its full use below) and have it calculate the formula for $t$ for us. The R 
code "``$statistic``" is basically a way of extracting just the number we want 
to use for $T$ from a larger set of output the ``t.test`` function wants to 
provide you. We will see below that ``t.test`` switches the order of the 
difference (now it is *Average* - *Unattractive*) -- always carefully check for 
the direction of the difference in the results. Since we are doing a two-sided 
test, the code resembles the permutation test code in Section \@ref(section2-4) 
with the new $t$-statistic replacing the difference in the sample means that we 
used before. 

\indent The permutation distribution in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-12) looks 
similar to the previous results with slightly different x-axis scaling. The 
observed $t$-statistic was $-2.17$ and the proportion of permuted results that 
were as or more extreme than the observed result 
was 0.031. This difference is due to a different set of random permutations 
being selected. If you run permutation code, you will often get slightly 
different results each time you run it. If you are uncomfortable with the 
variation in the results, you can run more than $B=$ 1,000 permutations (say 
10,000) and the variability in the resulting p-values will be reduced further. 
Usually this uncertainty will not cause any substantive problems -- but do not 
be surprised if your results vary from a colleagues if you are both analyzing 
the same data set or if you re-run your permutation code. 

(ref:fig2-12) Permutation distribution of the $t$-statistic.

plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=c(-1,1)*Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
```

\indent The parametric version of these results is based on using what is called 
the ***two-independent sample t-test***. There are actually two versions of this 
test, one that assumes that variances are equal in the groups and one that 
does not. There is a rule of thumb that if the **ratio of the larger standard
deviation over the smaller standard deviation is less than 2, the equal variance
procedure is OK**. It ends up that this assumption 
is less important if the sample sizes in the groups are approximately equal 
and more important if the groups contain different numbers of observations. In
comparing the two potential test statistics, the procedure that assumes equal
variances has a complicated denominator (see the formula above for $t$ 
involving $s_p$) but a simple formula for ***degrees of freedom*** (***df***)
for the $t$-distribution ($df=n_1+n_2-2$) that approximates the
distribution of the test statistic, $t$, under the null hypothesis. The 
procedure that assumes unequal variances has a simpler test statistic and a 
very complicated degrees of freedom formula. The equal variance procedure is 
most similar to the ANOVA methods we will consider in Chapters 
\@ref(chapter3) and \@ref(chapter4) so that 
will be our focus for the two group problem. Fortunately, both of these methods 
are readily available in the ``t.test`` function in R if needed. 

(ref:fig2-13) Plots of $t$ distributions with 2, 10, and 20 degrees of freedom 
and a normal distribution (dashed line). Note how the $t$ distributions get 
closer to the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase and at 20 
degrees of freedom, the $t$ distribution *almost* matches a standard normal 
curve.

```{r Figure2-13, echo=FALSE, fig.cap ="(ref:fig2-13)",fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
xa<-seq(from=-7,to=7,length.out=300)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

```

\indent If the assumptions for the equal variance $t$-test are met and the null 
hypothesis is true, then the sampling distribution of the test statistic should 
follow a $t$-distribution with $n_1+n_2-2$ degrees of freedom. The ***t-distribution*** is a bell-shaped curve that is more spread out for smaller 
values of degrees of freedom as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-13). The
$t$-distribution looks more and more like a ***standard normal distribution***
($N(0,1)$) as the degrees of freedom increase. 



\indent To get the p-value for the parametric $t$-test, we need to calculate the 
test statistic and $df$, then look up the areas in the tails of the 
$t$-distribution relative to the observed $t$-statistic. We'll learn how to use 
R to do this below, but for now we will allow the ``t.test`` function to take 
care of this. The ``t.test`` function uses our formula notation (``Years~Attr``) 
and then ``data=...`` as we saw before for making plots. To get the 
equal-variance test result, the ``var.equal=T`` option needs to be turned on.
Then ``t.test`` provides us with lots of useful output. The three results we've 
been discussing are available in the output below -- the test statistic value 
(-2.17), $df=73$, and the p-value, from the $t$-distribution with 73 degrees of freedom, of 0.033. 

```{r}
t.test(Years ~ Attr, data=MockJury2, var.equal=T)
```

So the parametric $t$-test gives a p-value of 0.033 from a test statistic of 
-2.1702. The negative sign on the test statistic occurred because the function 
took *Average* - *Unattractive* which is the opposite direction as ``diffmean``. 
The p-value is very similar to the two permutation results found before. The 
reason for this similarity is that the permutation distribution looks an awful
like a $t$-distribution with 73 degrees 
of freedom. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-14) shows how similar the two distributions
happened to be here. 

(ref:fig2-14) Plot of permutation and $t$ distribution with $df=73$. Note the 
close match in the two distributions, especially in the tails of the 
distributions where we are obtaining the p-values.

```{r Figure2-14, fig.cap ="(ref:fig2-14)", echo=F,fig.height=4,fig.width=6}

     xlab="T=t-statistic", lwd=2,ylim=c(0,0.45))

legend("topleft",legend=c("Permutation","t(73)"),col=c("black","red"),lty=c(1,2),
       lwd=c(1,2),cex=0.75)
```

\indent In your previous statistics course, you might have used an applet or 
a table to find p-values such as what was provided in the previous R output. 
When not directly provided in the output of a function, R can be used to look up 
p-values^[On exams, you will be asked to describe the area of interest, sketch a
picture of the area of interest, and/or note the distribution you would use.] from
named distributions such as the $t$-distribution. In this case, the distribution 
of the test statistic under the null hypothesis is a $t(73)$ or a $t$ with 73 
degrees of freedom. The ``pt`` function is used to get p-values from the
$t$-distribution in the same manner that ``pdata`` could help us to find p-values
from the permutation distribution. We need to provide the ``df=...`` and specify 
the tail of the distribution of interest using the ``lower.tail`` option along 
with the cutoff of interest. If we want the area to the left of -2.17:

```{r}
pt(-2.1702, df=73, lower.tail=T)
```

And we can double it to get the p-value that ``t.test`` provided earlier, because 
the $t$-distribution is symmetric:

```{r}
2*pt(-2.1702, df=73, lower.tail=T)
```

More generally, we could always make the test statistic positive using the 
absolute value, find the area to the right of it, and then double that for a 
two-sided test p-value:

```{r}
2*pt(abs(-2.1702), df=73, lower.tail=T)
```

\indent Permutation distributions do not need to match the named parametric
distribution to work correctly, although this happened in the previous example.
The parametric approach, the $t$-test, requires certain conditions to be met 
for the sampling distribution of the 
statistic to follow the named distribution and provide accurate p-values. The
conditions for the equal variance t-test are:


1. **Independent observations**: Each observation obtained is unrelated to all other
observations. To assess this, consider whether anything in the data collection
might lead to clustered or related observations that are un-related to the
differences in the groups. For example, was the same person measured more than
once?^[In some studies, the same subject might be measured in both conditions and 
this violates the assumptions of this procedure.]

2. **Equal variances** in the groups (because we used a procedure that assumes 
equal variances! -- there is another procedure that allows you to relax this
assumption if needed...). To assess this, compare the standard deviations and
variability in the beanplots and see if they look noticeably different. Be
particularly critical of this assessment if the sample sizes differ greatly 
between groups. 

3. **Normal distributions** of the observations in each group. We'll learn more
diagnostics later, but the boxplots and beanplots are a good place to start to 
help you look for skews or outliers, which were both present here. If you find 
skew and/or outliers, that would suggest a problem with the assumption of 
normality as normal distributions are symmetric and extreme observations occur 
very rarely. 

For the permutation test, we relax the third condition and replace it with:

3. ***Similar distributions between the groups:*** The permutation approach 
allows valid inferences as long as the two groups have similar shapes and only
possibly differ in their centers. In other words, the distributions need not 
look normal for the procedure to work well, but they do need to look similar. 

\indent In the prisoner "juror" study, we can assume that the independent 
observation condition is met because there is no information suggesting that 
the same subjects were measured more than once or that some other type of 
grouping in the responses was present (like the subjects were divided in 
groups and placed in rooms to discuss their responses prior to submitting 
them). The equal variance condition might be violated. The variances need 
not be equal as the procedure 
can still provide reasonable results with some violation of this assumption.
The standard deviations are 2.8 vs 4.4, so this difference is not "large" 
according to the rule of thumb noted above. It is, however, close to being 
considered problematic. It would be difficult to reasonably assume that the 
normality condition is met here (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-6)) with clear right 
skews in both groups and potential outliers which causes concerns for (3) for 
the parametric procedure. The shapes look similar for the two groups so there 
is less reason to be concerned with using the permutation approach based on 
its version of condition (3) above. 

\indent The permutation approach is resistant to impacts of violations of the
normality assumption. It is not resistant to impact of violations of any of 
the other assumptions. In fact, it can be quite sensitive to unequal variances 
as it will detect differences in the variances of the groups instead of 
differences in the means. Its scope of inference is the same as the parametric
approach. It also can provide similarly inaccurate conclusions in the presence 
of non-independent observations as for the parametric approach. In this 
example, we discover that parametric and permutation approaches provide very 
similar inferences. 

## Second example of permutation tests {#section2-7}

In every chapter, the first example, used to motivate and explain 
the methods, is followed with a "worked" example where we focus just on the 
results. In a 
previous semester, some of the STAT 217 students (***n***=79) provided 
information on their *Sex*, *Age*, and current cumulative *GPA*. We might be
interested in whether Males and Females had different average GPAs. First, 
we can take a look at the difference in the responses by groups based on the
output and as displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-15). 

```{r}
s217 <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/s217.csv")
require(mosaic)
require(beanplot)
mean(GPA~Sex, data=s217)
favstats(GPA~Sex, data=s217)
```

(ref:fig2-15) Side-by-side boxplot and beanplot of GPAs of STAT 217 students by sex.

```{r Figure2-15, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-15)", echo=F,cache=T}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
old.par <- par(mai=c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5))
boxplot(GPA~Sex, data=s217)
beanplot(GPA~Sex, data=s217, log="", col="lightblue", method="jitter")
```

```{r eval=F}
boxplot(GPA~Sex, data=s217)
beanplot(GPA~Sex, data=s217, log="", col="lightblue", method="jitter")
```

In these data, the distributions of the GPAs look to be left skewed but maybe not
as dramatically as the responses were right-skewed in the MockJury example. The 
Female GPAs look to be slightly higher than for Males (0.25 GPA difference in the
means) but is that a "real" difference? We need our inference tools to more fully
assess these differences. 

```{r}
diffmean(GPA~Sex, data=s217)
```

First, we can try the parametric approach:

```{r}
t.test(GPA~Sex, data=s217, var.equal=T)
```

```{r echo=F}
set.seed(201706)
B=1000
Tobs <- t.test(GPA~Sex, data=s217, var.equal=T)$statistic
Tstar <- matrix(NA, nrow=B)
for (b in (1:B)){
  Tstar[b] <- t.test(GPA~shuffle(Sex), data=s217, var.equal=T)$statistic
}
perm_pval = pdata(abs(Tstar),abs(Tobs),lower.tail=F)
```

\indent So the test statistic was observed to be $t=2.69$ and it hopefully 
follows a $t(77)$ distribution under the null hypothesis. This provides a 
p-value of 0.008713 that we can trust if all the conditions to use this 
procedure are met.
Compare these results to the permutation approach, which relaxes that normality
assumption, with the results that follow. In the permutation test, $T=2.692$ and 
the p-value is `r perm_pval` which is a little smaller than the result provided 
by the parametric approach. The agreement of the two approaches, again, provides 
some re-assurance about the use of either approach. 

```{r eval=F}
Tobs <- t.test(GPA~Sex, data=s217, var.equal=T)$statistic
Tstar <- matrix(NA, nrow=B)
for (b in (1:B)){
  Tstar[b] <- t.test(GPA~shuffle(Sex), data=s217, var.equal=T)$statistic
}
pdata(abs(Tstar), abs(Tobs), lower.tail=F)
```

(ref:fig2-16) Histogram and density curve of permutation distribution of test
statistic for STAT 217 GPAs.

```{r Figure2-16, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-16)",echo=F,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,cache=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(Tstar,labels=T,ylim=c(0,225))
abline(v=c(-1,1)*Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=c(-1,1)*Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
```

```{r eval=F}

plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=c(-1,1)*Tobs, lwd=2, col="red")
```

Here is a full write-up of the results using all 6+ hypothesis testing steps, 
using the permutation results for the grade data:

0. *Isolate the claim to be proved and method to use (define a test statistic T)*.
    We want to test for a difference in the means between males and females and 
    will use the equal variance two-sample t-test statistic to compare them, and 
    we think that the 5% significance level seems reasonable in this situation. 

1. Write the null and alternative hypotheses

    * $H_0: \mu_\text{male} = \mu_\text{female}$

        * where $\mu_\text{male}$ is the true mean GPA for males and
        $\mu_\text{female}$ is true mean GPA for females. 
        
    * $H_A: \mu_\text{male} \ne \mu_\text{female}$

2. Check conditions for the procedure being used

    * **Independent observations condition**: It appears that this assumption 
    is met because there is no reason to assume any clustering or grouping of
    responses that might create dependence in the observations. The only 
    possible consideration is that the observations were taken from different 
    sections and there could be some differences between the sections. However, 
    for overall GPA there is not too much likelihood that the overall GPAs 
    would vary greatly so this not likely to be a big issue. The only way this 
    could create a violation here is if certain sections tended to attract
    students with different GPA levels (such as the 9 am section had the
    best/worst GPA students...). 

    * **Equal variance condition**: There is a small difference in the range 
    of the observations in the two groups but the standard deviations are very 
    similar so there is no evidence that this condition is violated. 

    * **Similar distribution condition**: Based on the side-by-side boxplots and
    beanplots, it appears that both groups have slightly left-skewed 
    distributions, which could be problematic for the parametric approach, but 
    there is no evidence that the permutation approach condition is violated 
    since the distributions look to have fairly similar shapes. 

3. Find the value of the appropriate test statistic

    * $T=2.69$ from the previous R output. 

4. Find the p-value

    * p-value=`r perm_pval` from the permutation distribution results. 

    * This means that there is about a `r perm_pval*100`% chance we would observe 
    a difference in mean GPA (female-male or male-female) of 0.25 points or more 
    if there in fact is no difference in true mean GPA between females and males 
    in STAT 217 in a particular semester. 

5. Decision

    * Since the p-value is "small", we find strong evidence against the null
    hypothesis and can reject the null hypothesis. 

6. Conclusion and scope of inference, specific to the problem

    * There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference 
    in the true mean GPA between males and females for the STAT 217 students 
    in this semester and so we conclude that there is evidence of a difference 
    in the mean GPAs between males and females in STAT 217 students. 
    
    * Because this was not a randomized experiment, we can't say that the 
    difference in sex causes the difference in mean GPA and because it was 
    not a random sample from a larger population, our inferences only pertain 
    the STAT 217 students that responded to the survey in that semester. 
    
    * Females were estimated to have a higher mean GPA by 0.25 points. The next
    section discusses confidence intervals that we could add to this result to
    quantify the uncertainty in this estimate.

## Confidence intervals and bootstrapping {#section2-8}

Randomly shuffling the treatments between the observations is like randomly 
sampling the treatments without replacement. In other words, we randomly 
sample one observation at a time from the treatments until we have $n$
observations. This provides us with a technique 
for testing hypotheses because it provides new splits of the observations 
into groups that are as interesting as what we observed if the null hypothesis 
is assumed true. In most situations, we also want to estimate parameters of 
interest and provide ***confidence intervals*** for those parameters (an 
interval where we are __% ***confident*** that the true parameter lies). As 
before, there are two options we will consider -- a parametric and a 
nonparametric approach. The nonparametric approach will be using what is 
called ***bootstrapping*** and draws its name from "pull yourself up by 
your bootstraps" where you improve your situation based on your own efforts.
In statistics, we make our situation or inferences better by re-using the 
observations we have by assuming that the sample represents the population.
Since each observation represents other similar observations in the 
population that we didn't get to measure, if we ***sample with replacement***
to generate a new data set of size *n* from our data set (also of size *n*) 
it mimics the process of taking repeated random samples of size $n$ from our
population of interest. This process also 
ends up giving us useful sampling distributions of statistics even when our 
standard normality assumption is violated, similar to what we encountered 
in the permutation tests. Bootstrapping is especially useful in situations 
where we are interested in statistics other than the mean (say we want a 
confidence interval for a median or a standard deviation) or when we consider
functions of more than one parameter and don't want to derive the distribution 
of the statistic (say the difference in two medians). In this text, 
bootstrapping is used to provide more trustworthy inferences when some of our
assumptions (especially normality) might be violated for our parametric procedure. 

\indent To perform bootstrapping, we will use the ``resample`` function from the
``mosaic`` package. We can apply this function to a data set and get a new 
version of the 
data set by sampling new observations *with replacement* from the original one.
The new, bootstrapped version of the data set (called ``MockJury_BTS`` below) 
contains a new variable called ``orig.id`` which is the number of the subject 
from the original data set. By summarizing how often each of these id's
occurred in a bootstrapped data set, we can see how the re-sampling works.
The ``table`` function will count up how many times each observation was used in 
the bootstrap sample, providing a row with the id followed by a row with the 
count^[The ``as.numeric`` function is also used here. It really isn't important
but makes sure the output of ``table`` is sorted by observation number by first
converting the *orig.id* variable into a numeric vector.]. In the first bootstrap
sample shown, the 1^st^, 4^th^, and 10^th^ observations 
were sampled one time each, the 5^th^ observation was sampled three 
times, and the 7^th^, 8^th^, 9^th^, and many others 
were not sampled at all. Bootstrap sampling thus picks some observations 
multiple times and to do that it has to ignore some^[In any bootstrap sample, about 1/3 of the observations are not used at all.] observations. 


```{r}
MockJury_BTS <- resample(MockJury2)
table(as.numeric(MockJury_BTS$orig.id))
```

Like in permutations, one randomization isn't enough. A second bootstrap sample 
is also provided to help you get a sense of what bootstrap data sets contain. 
It did not select subject 7 but did select 6, 14, and 21 more than once.
You can see other variations in the resulting re-sampling of subjects with the 
most sampled subjects 6 and 50 sampled four times. With $n=75$, the the chance of
selecting any observation for any slot 
in the new data set is $1/75$ and the expected or mean number of appearances we 
expect to see for an observation is the number of random draws times the probably 
of selection on each so $75*1/75=1$. 

```{r}
MockJury_BTS2 <- resample(MockJury2)
table(as.numeric(MockJury_BTS2$orig.id))
```

We can use the two results to get an idea of distribution of results in terms 
of number of times observations might be re-sampled when sampling with 
replacement and the variation in those results, as shown in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-17). We could also derive the expected counts for
each number of times of re-sampling when we start with all observations having
an equal chance and sampling with replacement but this isn't important for
using bootstrapping methods. 

(ref:fig2-17) Counts of number of times of observation (or not observed for 
times re-sampled of 0) for two bootstrap samples. 

```{r Figure2-17, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-17)",echo=F,cache=T}
cs1<-table(as.vector(table(as.numeric(MockJury_BTS$orig.id))))
n0s<-75-sum(cs1)

cs1_final<-table(c(rep(0,n0s),as.vector(table(as.numeric(MockJury_BTS$orig.id)))))

cs2<-table(as.vector(table(as.numeric(MockJury_BTS2$orig.id))))
n0s<-75-sum(cs2)

cs2_final<-table(c(rep(0,n0s),as.vector(table(as.numeric(MockJury_BTS2$orig.id)))))

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(cs1_final,ylab="Counts of number of times of re-sampling",
     main="Bootstrap sample 1",xlab="Times re-sampled")
plot(cs2_final,ylab="Counts of number of times of re-sampling", 
     main="Bootstrap sample 2",xlab="Times re-sampled")
```

\indent The main point of this exploration was to see that each run of the
``resample`` function provides a new version of the data set. Repeating this 
$B$ times using
another ``for`` loop, we will track our quantity of interest, say $T$, in all 
these new "data sets" and call those results $T^*$. The distribution of the
bootstrapped $T^*$ statistics will tell us about the range of results to expect 
for the statistic and the middle __% of the $T^*$'s provides a 
***bootstrap confidence interval***^[There are actually many ways to use this
information to make a confidence interval. We are using the simplest method
that is called the "percentile" method.] for the true parameter -- here the *difference in the two population means*. 

\indent To make this concrete, we can revisit our previous examples, starting 
with the ``MockJury2`` data created before and our interest in comparing the 
mean sentences for the *Average* and *Unattractive* picture groups. The 
bootstrapping code is very similar to the permutation code except that we apply
the ``resample`` function to the entire data set as opposed to the ``shuffle``
function that was applied only to the explanatory variable. 

```{r}
Tobs <- diffmean(Years~Attr, data=MockJury2); Tobs
B <- 1000
Tstar <- matrix(NA, nrow=B)
for (b in (1:B)){
  Tstar[b] <- diffmean(Years~Attr, data=resample(MockJury2))
  }
favstats(Tstar)
```

(ref:fig2-18) Histogram and density curve of bootstrap distributions of 
difference in sample mean ``Years`` with vertical line for the observed 
difference in the means of 1.84 years.

```{r Figure2-18, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-18)",echo=F,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,cache=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(Tstar, labels=T,ylim=c(0,225))

```

abline(v=Tobs, col="red", lwd=2)
plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=Tobs, col="red", lwd=2)
```

In this situation, the observed difference in the mean sentences is 1.84 years
(*Unattractive* - *Average*), which is the vertical line in Figure
\@ref(fig:Figure2-18).
The bootstrap distribution shows the results for the difference in the sample 
means when fake data sets are re-constructed by sampling from the original data set with
replacement. The bootstrap distribution is approximately centered at the observed
value (difference in the sample means) and is relatively symmetric. 

\indent The permutation distribution in the same situation (Figure
\@ref(fig:Figure2-12)) had a similar shape but was centered at 0. 
Permutations create sampling 
distributions based on assuming the null hypothesis is true, which is useful for
hypothesis testing. Bootstrapping creates distributions centered at the observed
result, which is the sampling distribution "under the alternative" or when no null
hypothesis is assumed; bootstrap distributions are useful for generating 
confidence intervals for the true parameter values. 

\indent To create a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the difference in 
the true mean sentences ($\mu_\text{Unattr}-\mu_\text{Avg}$), select the 
middle 95% of results from 
the bootstrap distribution. Specifically, find the 2.5^th^ 
percentile and the 97.5^th^ percentile (values that put 2.5 and 97.5%
of the results to the left) in the bootstrap distribution, which leaves 95% in
the middle for the confidence interval. To find percentiles in a distribution
in R, functions are of the form ``q[Name of distribution]``, with the function
``qt`` extracting percentiles from a $t$-distribution (examples below). From the
bootstrap results, use the ``qdata`` function on the ``Tstar`` results that 
contain the bootstrap distribution of the statistic of interest. 

```{r}
qdata(Tstar, 0.025)
qdata(Tstar, 0.975)
```

These results tell us that the 2.5^th^ percentile of the bootstrap
distribution is at 0.24 years and the 97.5^th^ percentile is at 3.52 
years. We can combine these results to provide a 95% confidence for 
$\mu_\text{Unattr}-\mu_\text{Avg}$ that is between 0.24 and 3.52 years. We can 
interpret this 
as with any confidence interval, that we are 95% confident that the difference 
in the true mean suggested sentences (*Unattractive* minus *Average* groups) is 
between 0.24 and 3.52 years. We can also obtain both percentiles in one line 
of code using:

```{r}
quantiles <- qdata(Tstar, c(0.025,0.975))
quantiles
```

Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-19) displays those same percentiles on the bootstrap
distribution residing in ``Tstar``. 

(ref:fig2-19) Histogram and density curve of bootstrap distribution with 
95% bootstrap confidence intervals displayed (vertical lines).

```{r Figure2-19, fig.cap="(ref:fig2-19)",echo=F,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,cache=F}

plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=quantiles$quantile, col="blue", lwd=3)
```

\indent Although confidence intervals can exist without referencing hypotheses,
we can 
revisit our previous hypotheses and see what this confidence interval tells
us about the test of $H_0: \mu_\text{Unattr} = \mu_\text{Avg}$. This null 
hypothesis is equivalent to testing $H_0: \mu_\text{Unattr} - \mu_\text{Avg} = 0$,
that the difference 
in the true means is equal to 0 years. And the difference in the means was the 
scale for our confidence interval, which did not contain 0 years. We will call 
0 an interesting ***reference value*** for the confidence interval, because 
here it is the value where the true means are equal to each other (have a
difference of 0 years). In general, if our confidence interval does not contain 
0, then it is saying that 0 is not one of our likely values for the difference 
in the true means. This implies that we should reject a claim that they are 
equal. This provides the same inferences for the hypotheses that we considered
previously using both a parametric and permutation approach. 

\indent The general summary
is that we can use confidence intervals to test hypotheses by assessing whether 
the reference value under the null hypothesis is in the confidence interval
(FTR $H_0$) or outside the confidence interval (Reject $H_0$). P-values are more
informative about hypotheses (measure of evidence against the null hypothesis)
but confidence intervals are more informative
about the size of differences, so both offer useful information and, as shown
here, can provide consistent conclusions about hypotheses. 

\indent As in the previous situation, we also want to consider the parametric
approach 
for comparison purposes and to have that method available, especially to help 
us understand some methods where we will only consider parametric inferences 
in later chapters. The parametric confidence interval is called the 
***equal variance, two-sample t confidence interval*** and additionally 
assumes that the populations 
being sampled from are normally distributed. It leads to using a $t$-distribution
to form the interval. The output from the ``t.test`` function provides the 
parametric 95% confidence interval calculated for you:

```{r}
t.test(Years~Attr, data=MockJury2, var.equal=T)
```

The ``t.test`` function again switched the order of the groups and provides 
slightly different end-points than our bootstrap confidence interval (both are 
made at the 95% confidence level though), which was slightly narrower. Both 
intervals have the same interpretation, only the methods for calculating the 
intervals and the assumptions differ. Specifically, the bootstrap interval can
tolerate different distribution shapes other than normal and still provide 
intervals that work well^[When hypothesis tests "work well" they have high
power to detect differences while having Type I error rates that are close
to what we choose *a priori*. When confidence intervals "work well", they contain
the true parameter value in repeated random samples at around the selected
confidence level.]. The other assumptions are all the same as for the hypothesis 
test, where we continue to assume that we have independent observations with 
equal variances for the two groups. 

\indent The formula that ``t.test`` is using to calculate the parametric 
***equal variance two-sample t confidence interval*** is:

$$\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 \mp t^*_{df}s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}$$

In this situation, the *df* is again $n_1+n_2-2$ and 
$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}$. The $t^*_{df}$ is
a multiplier that comes from finding the percentile from the $t$-distribution 
that puts $C$% in the middle of the distribution with $C$ being the confidence 
level. It is important to note that this $t^*$ has nothing to do with the previous
test statistic $t$. It is confusing and many of you will, at some point, happily 
take the result from a test statistic calculation and use it for a multiplier
in a $t$-based confidence interval. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-20) shows the
$t$-distribution with 73 degrees of freedom and the cut-offs that put 95% of the 
area in the middle. 

(ref:fig2-20) Plot of $t(73)$ with cut-offs for putting 95% of distribution in 
the middle. 

```{r Figure2-20,fig.cap="(ref:fig2-20)",cache=T,echo=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
x<-seq(from=-4,to=4,length.out=200)
plot(x,dt(x,df=73),col="red",lty=2,lwd=3,type="l",xlab="t-values",ylab="Density",
     main="Plot of t(73) distribution" )
abline(v=-2.1702,lwd=3)
abline(v=2.1702,lwd=3)
```

For 95% confidence intervals, the multiplier is going to be close to 2 and 
anything else is a sign of a mistake. We can use R to get the multipliers for
confidence intervals using the ``qt`` function in a similar fashion to how 
``qdata`` was used in the bootstrap results, except that this new value must be 
used in the previous confidence interval formula. This function produces values 
for requested percentiles, so if we want to put 95% in the middle, we place 
2.5% in each tail of the distribution and need to request the 97.5^th^
percentile. Because the $t$-distribution is always symmetric around 0, we merely 
need to look up the value for the 97.5^th^ percentile and know that the
multiplier for the 2.5^th^ percentile is just $-t^*$. The $t^*$
multiplier to form the confidence interval is 1.993 for a 95% confidence interval 
when the $df=73$ based on the results from ``qt``:

```{r}
qt(0.975, df=73)
```

Note that the 2.5^th^ percentile is just the negative of this value due 
to symmetry and the real source of the minus in the minus/plus in the formula 
for the confidence interval. 

```{r}
qt(0.025, df=73)
```

We can also re-write the confidence interval formula into a slightly more 
general form as

$$\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 \mp t^*_{df}SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}\ \text{ OR }\ 
\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 \mp ME$$

where $SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} = s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}$ and 
$ME = t^*_{df}SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}$. In some situations, researchers will
report the ***standard error*** (SE) or ***margin of error*** (ME) as a method 
of quantifying the uncertainty in a statistic. The SE is an estimate of the
standard deviation of the statistic (here $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$) and the ME 
is an estimate of the precision of a statistic that can be used to directly 
form a confidence interval. The ME depends on the choice of confidence level 
although 95% is almost always selected. 

\indent To finish this example, R can be used to help you do calculations much 
like a calculator except with much more power "under the hood". You have to 
make sure you are careful with using ``( )`` to group items and remember that 
the asterisk (*) is used for multiplication in R. We need the pertinent 
information which is available from the ``favstats`` output repeated below to 
calculate the confidence interval "by hand"^[We will often use this term to 
mean from the component summary information -- not that you need to go back to 
the data set and calculate the means and standard deviations.] using R. 

```{r}
favstats(Years~Attr, data=MockJury2)
```

Start with typing the following command to calculate $s_p$ and store it in a 
variable named ``sp``:

```{r}
sp <- sqrt(((38-1)*(2.8235^2)+(37-1)*(4.364^2))/(38+37-2))
sp
```

Then calculate the confidence interval that ``t.test`` provided using:

```{r}
3.974-5.811+c(-1,1)*qt(0.975, df=73)*sp*sqrt(1/38+1/37)
```

The previous code uses ``c(-1, 1)`` times the margin of error to subtract and add 
the ME to the difference in the sample means ($3.974-5.811$), which generates the
lower and then upper bounds of the confidence interval. If desired, we can also 
use just the last portion of the previous calculation to find the margin of error,
which is 1.69 here. 

```{r}
qt(0.975, df=73)*sp*sqrt(1/38+1/37)
```

## Bootstrap confidence intervals for difference in GPAs {#section2-9}

We can now apply the new confidence interval methods on the STAT 217 grade data. 
This time we start with the parametric 95% confidence interval "by hand" in R
and then use ``t.test`` to verify our result. The ``favstats`` output provides 
us with the required information to calculate the confidence interval:

```{r}
favstats(GPA~Sex, data=s217)
```

The $df$ are $37+42-2 = 77$. Using the SDs from the two groups and their sample 
sizes, we can calculate $s_p$:

```{r}
sp <- sqrt(((37-1)*(0.4075^2)+(42-1)*(0.41518^2))/(37+42-2))
sp
```

The margin of error is:

```{r}
qt(0.975, df=77)*sp*sqrt(1/37+1/42)
```

All together, the 95% confidence interval is:

```{r}
3.338-3.0886+c(-1,1)*qt(0.975, df=77)*sp*sqrt(1/37+1/42)
```

So we are 95% confident that the difference in the true mean GPAs between 
females and males (females minus males) is between 0.065 and 0.434 GPA points. 
We get a similar^[We rounded the means a little and that caused the small
difference in results.] result from the ``t.test`` output:

```{r}
t.test(GPA~Sex,data=s217,var.equal=T)
```

Note that we can easily switch to 90% or 99% confidence intervals by simply 
changing the percentile in ``qt`` or changing the ``conf.level`` option in the
``t.test`` function. In the following two lines of code, we added 
octothorpes^[You can correctly call octothorpes *number* symbols or, in the 
twitter verse, *hashtags*. For more on this symbol, see
"http://blog.dictionary.com/octothorpe/". Even after reading this, I call them 
number symbols.](#) and then some text after function
calls to explain what is being calculated. In computer code, octothorpes
provide a way of adding comments that tell the software (here R) to ignore any
text after a "#" on a given line. In the color version of the text, comments are 
also clearly distinguished. 

```{r}
qt(0.95, df=77) # For 90% confidence and 77 df
qt(0.995, df=77) #For 99% confidence and 77 df
t.test(GPA~Sex, data=s217, var.equal=T, conf.level=0.90)
t.test(GPA~Sex, data=s217, var.equal=T, conf.level=0.99)
```

\indent As a review of some basic ideas with confidence intervals make sure 
you can answer the following questions:

1. What is the impact of increasing the confidence level in this situation? 

2. What happens to the width of the confidence interval if the size of the 
SE increases or decreases? 

3. What about increasing the sample size -- should that increase or decrease 
the width of the interval? 

All the general results you learned before about impacts to widths of CIs hold 
in this situation whether we are considering the parametric or bootstrap methods...

\indent To finish this example, we will generate the comparable bootstrap 90%
confidence interval using the bootstrap distribution in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-21). 

```{r}
Tobs <- diffmean(GPA~Sex, data=s217); Tobs
B <- 1000
Tstar <-matrix(NA, nrow=B)
for (b in (1:B)){
  Tstar[b]<-diffmean(GPA ~ Sex, data=resample(s217))
  }
qdata(Tstar, 0.05)
qdata(Tstar, 0.95)
quantiles <- qdata(Tstar, c(0.05, 0.95))
quantiles
```

The output tells us that the 90% confidence interval is from -0.393 to -0.094 GPA
points. The bootstrap distribution with the observed difference in the sample 
means and these cut-offs is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure2-21) using 
this code:

(ref:fig2-21) Histogram and density curve of bootstrap distribution of 
difference in sample mean GPAs (male minus female) with observed difference 
(solid vertical line) and quantiles that delineate the 90% confidence intervals
(dashed vertical lines). 

```{r Figure2-21,fig.cap="(ref:fig2-21)",echo=F,fig.width=10,fig.height=5,cache=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(Tstar,labels=T,ylim=c(0,225))
abline(v=Tobs,col="red",lwd=2)
abline(v=quantiles$quantile,col="blue",lwd=3,lty=2)
plot(density(Tstar),main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=Tobs,col="red",lwd=2)
abline(v=quantiles$quantile,col="blue",lwd=3,lty=2)
```

```{r eval=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(Tstar,labels=T)
abline(v=Tobs,col="red",lwd=2)
abline(v=quantiles$quantile,col="blue",lwd=3,lty=2)
plot(density(Tstar),main="Density curve of Tstar")
abline(v=Tobs,col="red",lwd=2)
abline(v=quantiles$quantile,col="blue",lwd=3,lty=2)
```

In the previous output, the parametric 90% confidence interval is from 
0.095 to 0.404, suggesting similar results again from the two approaches once 
you account for the two different orders of differencing of the groups. Based on 
the bootstrap CI, we can say that we are 90% confident that the difference in 
the true mean GPAs for STAT 217 students is between -0.393 to -0.094 GPA points 
(male minus females). Because sex cannot be assigned to the subjects, we cannot 
infer that sex is causing this difference and because this was a voluntary 
response sample of STAT 217 students in a given semester, we cannot infer that 
a difference of this size would apply to all STAT 217 students or, certainly, 
students this semester. 

\indent Throughout the text, pay attention to the distinctions between parameters 
and statistics, focusing on the differences between estimates based on the sample 
and inferences for the population of interest in the form of the parameters of
interest. Remember that statistics are summaries of the sample information and
parameters are characteristics of populations (which we rarely know). And that 
our inferences are limited to the population that we randomly sampled from, if 
we randomly sampled.

## Chapter summary {#section2-10}

In this chapter, we reviewed basic statistical inference methods in the context 
of a two-sample mean problem. You were introduced to using R to do permutation 
testing and generate bootstrap confidence intervals as well as obtaining 
parametric $t$-test and confidence intervals in this same situation. You should 
have learned how to use a ``for`` loop for doing the nonparametric inferences
and the ``t.test`` function for generating parametric inferences. In the two
examples considered, the parametric and nonparametric methods provided similar
results, suggesting that the assumptions were at least close to being met for
the parametric procedures. When parametric and nonparametric approaches
disagree, the nonparametric methods are likely to be more trustworthy since
they have less restrictive assumptions but can still have problems. 

\indent When the noted conditions are not met in a hypothesis testing situation, the 
Type I error rates can be inflated, meaning that we reject the null hypothesis 
more often than we have allowed to occur by chance. Specifically, we could have 
a situation where our assumed 5% significance level test might actually reject 
the null when it is true 20% of the time. If this is occurring, we call a 
procedure ***liberal*** (it rejects too easily) and if the procedure is liberal,
how could we trust a small p-value to be a "real" result and not just an 
artifact of violating the assumptions of the procedure? Likewise, for 
confidence intervals we hope that our 95% confidence level procedure, when 
repeated, will contain the true parameter 95% of the time. If our assumptions 
are violated, we might actually have an 80% confidence level procedure and it 
makes it hard to trust the reported results for our observed data set. 
Statistical inference relies on a belief in the methods underlying our 
inferences. If we don't trust our assumptions, we shouldn't trust the 
conclusions to perform the way we want them to. As sample sizes increase 
and/or violations of conditions lessen, then the procedures will perform better. 
In Chapter \@ref(chapter3), some new tools for doing diagnostics are introduced
to help us assess how much those validity conditions are violated. 

## Summary of important R code {#section2-11}

The main components of R code used in this chapter follow with components to

## Practice problems {#section2-12}

Load the ``HELPrct`` data set from the ``mosaicData`` package [@R-mosaicData] 
(you need to 
install the ``mosaicData`` package once to be able to load it). The HELP study 
was a clinical trial for adult inpatients recruited from a
detoxification unit. Patients with no primary care physician were randomly
assigned to receive a multidisciplinary assessment and a brief motivational
intervention or usual care and various outcomes were observed. Two of the
variables in the data set are ``sex``, a factor with levels *male* and *female* 
and ``daysanysub`` which is the time (in days) to first use of any substance
post-detox. We are interested in the difference in mean number of days to first 
use of any substance post-detox between males and females. There are some 
missing responses and the following code will produce ``favstats`` with the 
missing values and then provide a data set that by 
applying the ``na.omit`` function removes any observations with missing 
values. 

```
require(mosaicData)
data(HELPrct)
HELPrct2 <- HELPrct[, c("daysanysub", "sex")] #Just focus on two variables
HELPrct3 <- na.omit(HELPrct2) #Removes subjects with missing values
favstats(daysanysub~sex, data=HELPrct2)
favstats(daysanysub~sex, data=HELPrct3)
```

2.1. Based on the results provided, how many observations were missing for males 
and females? Missing values here likely mean that the subjects didn't use any
substances post-detox in the time of the study but might have at a later 
date -- the study just didn't run long enough. This is called ***censoring***.
What is the problem with the numerical summaries here if the missing responses 
were all something larger than the largest observation?

2.2. Make a beanplot and a boxplot of ``daysanysub`` ~ ``sex`` using the 
``HELPrct3`` data set created above. Compare the distributions, recommending
parametric or nonparametric inferences. 

2.3. Generate the permutation results and write out the 6+ steps of the 
hypothesis test, making sure to note the numerical value of observed test 
statistic you are using and include a discussion of the scope of inference. 

2.4. Interpret the p-value for these results. 

2.5. Generate the parametric ``t.test`` results, reporting the test-statistic, 
its distribution under the null hypothesis, and compare the p-value to those
observed using the permutation approach. 

2.6. Make and interpret a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the difference 
in the means.
